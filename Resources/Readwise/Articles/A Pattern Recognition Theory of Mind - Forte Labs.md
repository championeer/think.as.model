## Highlights
- many of the capabilities of the human mind can be extended and amplified now, using standard, off-the-shelf hardware and software.
- Think of your favorite song. Try to start singing it from a completely random starting point. You’ll find it’s difficult. You either want to start at a natural break point like a verse or chorus, or you have to play it in your head from the beginning in order to “find” a random spot.
- This implies that our memories are organized in discrete segments. If you try to start mid-segment, you’ll struggle for a bit until your sequential memory kicks in.
- Do you know your social security number by heart? Now try reciting the numbers backward. You’ll find it’s very difficult or impossible to do without either writing them down, or at least visualizing them in your head.
- This implies that your memories are sequential, like symbols on a ticker tape. They are designed to be read in a certain direction and in order.
- Now think about a simple habit like brushing your teeth. If you look closely, it consists of many small steps: pick up the toothbrush, squeeze some toothpaste onto the bristles, turn on the faucet, wet the bristles, and so on. If you look even closer, each of these small actions contains many even smaller steps, down to individual muscles flexing and neurons firing. All of this activity you perform effortlessly, each sequence triggered by a decision.
- This implies that your memories are nested. Every action and thought is made up of smaller actions and thoughts.
- Which structure best describes nested segments organized in sequential order?
  A hierarchy.
- The basic structure and functioning of the human brain is hierarchical.
- Language evolved to take advantage of the hierarchical structure of our brains. Every concept is made up of smaller concepts, all the way down to the most fundamental ideas. We call this array of recursively linked concepts our “conceptual hierarchy.”
- Because reality itself is hierarchical: trees contains branches; branches contain leaves; leaves contain cells; cells contain organelles. Buildings contain floors; floors contain rooms; rooms contain doorways, windows, walls, and floors. Every object in the universe has parts, and those parts are made up of even smaller parts.
- So if human cognition is hierarchical, what are these hierarchies made up of?
  Patterns.
- Our brain is weak at processing logic, remembering facts, and making calculations, but pattern recognition is its deep core capability.
- The way our brains work is through massively parallel pattern recognition. And the organ that has evolved to perform this activity is the neocortex.
