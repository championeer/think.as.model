- Full Title: Become a Free Thinker
- Category: #articles
- Summary: This doesn't make sense, because every individual is limited by their unique perceptions, which are dictated by their environment, experience, and state of consciousness.

## Highlights
- Before we can understand what deep thinking is, we need to understand the opposite: shallow thinking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gh58g5s5jpadjb34pq6mwfgp))
- Shallow thinking is taking what you see as real, or never seeing beyond the surface of your perceptions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gh58gy4ed6ynwkv20tzzqy8j))
- **Deep thinking is:**
  • Becoming aware of the limits your mind creates.
  • Holding everything you perceive in the realm of possibility until filtered with direct experience.
  • Questioning everything, especially the thoughts, beliefs, and biases that you *think* are absolutely true without exception. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gh5jfvmq15xptnnp3hzxft4d))
    - Note: 知道限制；不要轻易下结论；不要想当然；质疑一切
- In short, **closed-mindedness** is the antagonist of deep thinking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gh5jqcedzgs2knr66wtms0sc))
- To be conscious is a struggle between novelty and habit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gh5jt675v8mnr9q59t3y7r30))
- You see, all understanding is metaphorical ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gha3v2wa7h8r1z0d5zyv8npm))
- Now, what you have to understand is that a symbol is a *representation* . It is not what that thing *is* . ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gha3yfjgkm41wky5fe2z2a4h))
- **Crucial note:** these symbols are mental interpretations. They are mental constructions, a layer over reality. A limit that our minds' imposed on the infinite. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gha426fcq8a1skk1h6psfjs8))
- With time, these mental constructions became more advanced. We've constructed language, culture, society, the school system, government, and a load of other expectations, assumptions, and predictions (called "beliefs") for what life has been and should be. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gha454a5xm6cn7rbjk5javzr))
    - Note: 类似《人类简史》中的观点，想象的共同体，也就是这里所说的mental constructions
- You can live and die inside these intellectual structures if you choose to. But people of curiosity… usually find themselves unsatisfied with the conventional answers. – Terrence McKenna ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gha4a0evb0j1dgb5fr1rzg7w))
- Speaking of seasons, the world, universe, and cosmos as a whole seem to go through cycles that impact human behavior from the top down. Cosmic > worldly > cultural > societal > social > personal. All have cycles. This even reflects in politics or government. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gha4x4x7tafay6gxxprpfsdp))
- Knowing is second order, being is first order ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghcpb56kr7hfhs4ny0peyaxq))
    - Note: 存在和认知，我们的认知只是心理（或大脑）对存在处理过的信息，不是存在本身
- This illusory "matrix" of expectations for what is, was, and should be are chaining you to a life of limited potential. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gha55k2azj8ezqqdwkq59tsv))
    - Note: 想象（或期望），是一种限制
- In order to reverse this effect, we have to create a glitch in the matrix by pushing the boundaries of what we know. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghcpy56ragseq06pfhbjgc4t))
- We have to expose ourselves to deeper experiences, both tangible and intangible if we want to be deep, articulate, and clear thinkers in a world of distraction and noise. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghcq3068hhmxpcqvgbfpw028))
- **The Known is the web of expectations** that we mentally reside in. It is the comfortable home that our mind can resort to when its survival is threatened. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghe8gm2wkma9kg8dvshw5r39))
    - Note: 思想的舒适区
- **The Unknown is the fabric of reality** , the land of infinite potential. An interconnected playground for those that are brave enough to push deeper and deeper with time, practice, and mindfulness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghe8mpzwqeqrn7rremg72t8p))
- **States** : a temporary state of consciousness that you can break into at anytime. Like taking a psychedelic, reading a quote that eases your worries, or feeling extra creative after you write a few words. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghf7envrj9ph5snh0pda3xf0))
- **Stages** : a permanent stage of consciousness, like reaching a new level in a game where you have access to the powers you could only previously receive with a power-up. Like a baseline level of happiness. This takes development over time, and does not eliminate regressing into lower *states* of consciousness, like being stuck in a rut. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghf7hmr37pcbz078q835fa3q))
- Our goal is to reach new *stages* of the unknown. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghf7jxesxp2zq2arthxsbr9n))
- In business, you wouldn't copy a billion-dollar business's advertising strategy if you haven't made your first dollar. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghf820z5pdh4fytrnbt6xc8m))
- So, it only makes sense to match knowledge with execution. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghf84tbkbpfxb3kc6jfexj7c))
