## Highlights
- Communication is the essence of winning people to your way of thinking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghzn9k9fn6rw0frp17zkh163))
- And storytelling is the essence of communication. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghzn9r0xg3efmxs7wy5v809x))
- Rule #1: You admire a character for trying more than for their successes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghzrvd4k68mqe092bsr7fj1x))
- For stories, brands, and products - focus on the how and why (and less on the what). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghzrwz76k9m3p8qebajy5e93))
- Rule #2: You gotta keep in mind what’s interesting to you as an audience, not what’s fun to do as a writer. They can be very different. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghzx363m51wg4t75ze1ar96e))
- Rule #3: Trying for theme is important, but you won’t see what the story is actually about til you’re at the end of it. Now rewrite. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghzx7eqyj2h16x37x6031wam))
- So don't overthink it - take something, get it going, then refine it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghzx9996616m6r3t67d2me2e))
- How can you say the same things, but in different ways? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj18avdw84f8vjhe1ptcmtrf))
- Rule #7: Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj18e38sj8j78axjgvpg0hpa))
    - Note: 从结果倒推
- Rule #4: Once upon a time there was ___. Every day, ___. One day ___. Because of that, ___. Because of that, ___. Until finally ___. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghzxaj53gczyn5fab22g8e47))
- Stories, sales pages, brand pitches - always start with the end in mind and work backward from there. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj18f7bvd1hgv6xc1p7ae8rp))
- Whether you're a writer, an entrepreneur, or a brand, you can use this "story spine" to effortlessly create a narrative. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghzxayanfa5gt71v28revzx5))
- Rule #8: Finish your story, let go even if it’s not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj18h2bf7zb96nfpn75rh8zy))
- Rule #5: Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You’ll feel like you’re losing valuable stuff but it sets you free. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghzxd9re4zqymwq2nez1prkg))
- The goal for every writer, marketer, or entrepreneur should be to add constraints and do more with less. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghzxf3ehjwspk609cqy3y0qz))
- Rule #9: When you’re stuck, make a list of what WOULDN’T happen next. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj18jtrhb4t4n0dw79nh9pck))
- Rule #6: What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ghzy4epxfs58th4z5kssdfnd))
- Rule #10: Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj18n7pjq2wg0dybezw0pv6h))
- Notice when things resonate with you and start asking why. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj18qhz85t7adsmdhmjcrg7v))
- Rule #11: Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you’ll never share it with anyone. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj195zq1p15kt4mxap5wxyzv))
- Your head is the worst place to store ideas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj19743q779w8ggmbq084n5p))
- Rule #12: Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind. And the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th – get the obvious out of the way. Surprise yourself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj197r1qe6ddfbypkrhv93yk))
- To find your best ideas, you need to unclog all the junk first. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj198s6b8r829n2cwhqnaqye))
- Rule #13: Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it’s poison to the audience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj199wcn211pqgq246v42rw2))
    - Note: 莫要说教，让读者自己思考
- Rule #14: Why must you tell THIS story? What’s the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That’s the heart of it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj19h3b5tcvqg2nfzwbdsz9k))
- Rule #15: If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj19tq3r7jcnq9mh097nx867))
- Rule #16: What are the stakes? Give us a reason to root for the character. What happens if they don’t succeed? Stack the odds against. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj19vtw24fvbecstaga8w38q))
    - Note: 规则16：利害关系是什么？给我们一个支持这个角色的理由。如果他们不成功会怎样？摆出反对的赔率。
- Rule #17: No work is ever wasted. If it’s not working, let go and move on - it’ll come back around to be useful later. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj1a1397cjafxycjcnjwwm4r))
- So focus on showing up - consistency creates competence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj1a2jhkbe31y5bkghkp01tf))
- Rule #18: You have to know yourself: the difference between doing your best & fussing. Story is testing, not refining. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj1a4e4r8cneaakf70h6dd2n))
- And this "planning" is really procrastination in disguise. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj1a5ybteb2d5ms2p8qtsc4b))
    - Note: 行动比计划重要；想到就去写
- Rule #19: Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj1aah2tdv12ps7thy9nrg2p))
- Rule #20: Exercise: take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How would you rearrange them into what you DO like? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj1acv6vm7drkv37kfz7dap3))
    - Note: 通过将不喜欢的改造为喜欢的，练习好的结构
- Rule #21: You gotta identify with your situation/characters, can’t just write ‘cool’. What would make YOU act that way? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj1agm0phv6bxmy6nm74e55e))
    - Note: 一个故事，你自己首先要相信
- Make your listener feel understood (through authenticity). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj1aj4swaynp8g8vkct5qese))
    - Note: 能让人产生共鸣的，首先是让他感受到被理解的温情
- Rule #22: What’s the essence of your story? Most economical telling of it? If you know that, you can build from there. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gj1anyxta2mf6z6ct23xvvem))
