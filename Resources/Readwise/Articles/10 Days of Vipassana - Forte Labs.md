## Highlights
- Attention is a skill — if you don’t cultivate it, it will atrophy
- 80% of happiness is just paying attention
- A team at Harvard recently conducted a large-scale study on happiness, polling more than 60,000 people three times daily for a one-month period on numerous factors related to their happiness: exercise, sleep, social interaction, satisfaction, use of technology, and many others.
  Do you know what they found to be the #1 predictor of unhappiness across the entire study?
  Not paying attention to what you were doing. And it didn’t matter if the thing you were thinking about was more positive or negative than what you were doing. Just the fact of not being present was the cause. Now think of the implications for a society where none of us is truly paying attention to anything we do.
  It’s true, happiness comes from within. But if you can’t perceive it, it is invisible to you. If “80% of success is just showing up,” then I believe that 80% of happiness is just paying attention.
- 3. Distractions are a lasting, subconscious mental habit
- 4. Paying attention to something takes away its power
- So much of our lives is dominated by fear of pain. We take a job out of fear of the pain of not finding something better, or we turn down the job out of fear of the pain of uncertainty. We start a company out of fear of the pain of working for 40 years with nothing to show for it, or we don’t start a company because of the fear of the pain of failing.
- But what if depriving pain of much of its power was as simple as paying attention to it? Anger, doubt, shame, envy, vengeance — all these feelings have such a hold over us only because they operate in the dark. Shine a light on them, and they wither.
- But in my work with behavior change, I know that such approaches are bound to fail. I see it instead as a shifted trajectory — a tiny course change now will be magnified over time, until one day I will indeed be a different person as a result of small habits I have built into my thinking, my environment, and my life.
