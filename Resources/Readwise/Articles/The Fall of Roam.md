## Highlights
- When I write my notes the thought, ‘Where am I going to put this?’ plagues me every time. It’s a direct and immediate pain. And it sometimes gets in the way of me even taking notes at all. I have this sensation many times a day and it’s deeply uncomfortable.
- Today, this is my stack: * Daily Diary / paper notebook * Book Notes / split between Roam and Muse * To-do List / Things * Meeting Notes / Apple Notes
- The underlying genius of Roam is that it is structured not like a tool, but like a programming language. It’s based on the insight that the best way to organize information depends on how you’re going to use it, and that information can be used in an infinite number of ways. So having an infinitely flexible organization system—like a programming language—is the best foundation for a note-taking system.
