## Highlights
- Learning in the 21st century is not about acquiring more information, knowledge, or even insights. The goal is to maximize the throughput of invalidated assumptions. But you have to get there one step at a time.
- If you are lucky enough to go beyond this, the bottleneck moves once again: to your assumptions. They constrain your view, what you are allowed to see, and thereby the thoughts and actions available to you. You start getting a kick out of unearthing new assumptions, shining a light on blindspots that, by definition, you didn’t know you didn’t know about. This process is unbounded, because with enough examination, all your beliefs are revealed to be assumptions.
- There are many ways to reveal assumptions. Interesting experiences, traveling, genuine conversation, and reading fiction all help you question your own point of view. But using throughput in particular to model learning gives us access to new frameworks and metaphors drawn from decades of manufacturing production experience. What does that history teach us about how to maximize throughput?
- The first lesson is that quantity and quality are not opposing forces. You don’t have to sacrifice one to get more of the other. One can be used to enhance the other, like two sides of a coin.
- TPS is not a process for maximizing the throughput of finished products, as we’ve always assumed and admired. It is a process for maximizing the throughput of process improvements, even at the expense of short-term profitability.
- Similarly, modern learning is not a process for maximizing the throughput of insights, but for maximizing the throughput of learning process improvements.
- This is why meditation retreats, globe-trotting, and having kids will always be net productivity gains, broadly defined: even a slight improvement in the machinery of learning (via a shift in perspective, for example) will pay dividends over time far greater than a mere few months of lost labor.
- When you push a system to sufficient speed, it starts consuming itself, like a black hole turning inside out and emerging through the wormhole into an alternate dimension, where all the laws and rules are completely different.
- all the levels of abstraction are always present and possible, it’s just a matter of which level we want to operate at.
- ake, for example, the phenomenon we observed with the evolution of learning, which is present in any complex, interdependent system: once you relieve a constraint, it moves.
- You could continue to accelerate this process, pushing your team to continuously identify and relieve bottlenecks as soon as they emerge.
- “Solving” for a particular constraint is no longer an objective in itself, but a way to keep the game going.
- You can start to develop an instinct for where the constraint is likely to move next, how it will behave once it gets there, and what pattern its movement will follow over time.
