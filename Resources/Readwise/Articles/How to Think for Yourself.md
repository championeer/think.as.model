## Highlights
- Your ideas have to be both correct and novel.
- You need to say things no one else has realized yet.
- The only valuable insights are the ones most other investors don't share.
- You see this pattern with startup founders too. You don't want to start a startup to do something that everyone agrees is a good idea, or there will already be other companies doing it. You have to do something that sounds to most other people like a bad idea, but that you know isn't like writing software for a tiny computer used by a few thousand hobbyists, or starting a site to let people rent airbeds on strangers' floors.
- Ditto for essayists. An essay that told people things they already knew would be boring. You have to tell them something new.
- There may even be a phenomenon like Dunning-Kruger at work, where the most conventional-minded people are confident that they're independent-minded, while the genuinely independent-minded worry they might not be independent-minded enough.
- One of the most effective techniques is one practiced unintentionally by most nerds: simply to be less aware what conventional beliefs are.
- If you're surrounded by conventional-minded people, it will constrain which ideas you can express, and that in turn will constrain which ideas you have.
- But if you surround yourself with independent-minded people, you'll have the opposite experience: hearing other people say surprising things will encourage you to, and to think of more.
