## Highlights
- Creativity is the ability to make connections between ideas and information. Productivity is the ability to make effective use of your time and creativity to accomplish a goal. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/629b0e49-5ee1-4a8b-88a9-b5ef96a5fa12))
- The more creative connections you can make, and the faster you can execute on them, the better you’ll be at knowledge work. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/76ad9ac5-c961-434a-b1b2-32170a6eb59b))
- Psychologists found no difference in productivity between people working in organized environments and those working in cluttered ones. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/4a59a892-44f8-4a47-b082-bbd1de616cf6))
- The first section in your storage system will be an inbox. This is the first place your information and notes will go when you save them. Forte explains that you should sort information into a more specific folder later to save time and ensure it’s put in the best location. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/5e9de7d0-f0f8-41c5-88a5-5051d84d49fe))
- Your current goals folder is where you’ll store information and notes pertaining to the goals and projects you’re currently working on. (This corresponds to Forte’s “Projects” folder in the PARA system.) Within this folder will be subfolders for each goal and project. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/d96196e1-1888-4639-98d7-7c5d401aaf29))
- Your ongoing engagements folder will contain subfolders for information on commitments that require continuous maintenance. (This corresponds to Forte’s “Areas” folder in the PARA system.) ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/ea3387fd-cac5-4ba0-9c6b-93194a94e793))
- Your topics-of-interest folder will contain subfolders for concepts or areas that you’re interested in learning more about but haven’t yet turned into a project or engagement. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/131b7fbc-2842-4251-a97f-953f52f87bb7))
- Finally, the hold folder is where you’ll store old or currently irrelevant material—things you want to place on hold for the time being. ﻿(This corresponds to Forte’s “Archives” folder in the PARA system.) ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/efa16382-2475-4b74-bcf9-2b4ea5a5a30d))
- First, you must expand the possibilities of a project or goal to include all relevant information and resources. Then, you must contract by narrowing your scope, cutting extra information, and refining your product or idea until you have a final result. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/0184d8bc-7c40-44c8-af7a-4c403b3887e2))
    - Note: 先做加法，再做减法
- Forte explains that the first two steps of using your ESS are to record information and sort it into relevant folders where you can utilize it (these are the condense and organize steps of Forte’s CODE system for saving information). ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/8552f4f7-7ae8-496a-a52e-92bcbdd62b1f))
- The second two steps of using your ESS are to refine your notes to their most important parts and use them to create something (these are the distill and express steps of Forte’s CODE system). ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/2a8e6f68-db9c-4d92-b49d-b21443828d1c))
- Forte warns to only save information that resonates with you or makes you reflect—it must be either inspiring, useful, personally important, or something that changes your current ideas or beliefs. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/91006523-1069-443e-89ec-4a9445513e09))
- When you record information, save only what’s necessary for it to be actionable and for you to remember why it’s important. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/af5cd7d7-a8e1-473b-8a3f-21f51de4c308))
- Next, Forte explains that you should sort your saved information out of your inbox and into your folders at a designated time, not immediately after saving something. He recommends setting time aside at least once a week to clear your inbox and sort information into folders and sub-folders. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/2400c120-f544-4553-90d1-978031b42016))
- When sorting information, Forte says that you should first see if it fits in any of your current goals sub-folders. If not, consider your ongoing engagements subfolders. If it doesn’t fit there, see if it’s relevant to any of your areas of interest subfolders. If you can’t find a sub-folder to sort the information into but still feel like it might be relevant someday, put it into your hold folder. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/a475d820-fd9f-484f-a2d3-621e6bf7c493))
    - Note: 就是按PARA顺序，依次看信息放到哪里合适
- Forte explains that refining your notes—distilling them into their most basic format and removing any irrelevant information—should take place right before you create something based on those notes. This shouldn’t take place at the same time as recording or sorting. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/8cb07c1b-567d-48fc-a370-360f8339cc6c))
- To effectively refine your notes, Forte recommends using the following process (which he calls Progressive Summarization): ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/95235a09-c5fc-41f7-a49d-3cc27c70f78b))
    - Note: Forte的这套笔记优化流程有争议，反对者的意见似乎也很有道理
- Since you’ve already saved the smallest bit of information from the source, as we discussed in the Record section, you’ll start the refinement process by bolding the main points of the small chunk of information you’ve saved. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/4bbd8889-f695-439c-8a1f-28f97fd7cf24))
- Then, for especially unique or valuable notes, Forte recommends including a short summary that explains the main points of the source and why you’ve saved it (if you might forget) in as few words as possible. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/91f30d44-b49a-41f1-b296-0d4af47ed458))
- Collector’s Fallacy: collecting and engaging with information is easy and makes you feel like you’ve made progress toward goals even if you haven’t actually created anything. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/e3b9e9d1-6a10-4b53-b528-0cb9517f3b24))
- Strategy #1: Discard Useless Information and Create Task Bundles ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/b5151a2e-403d-4216-8659-245a7d346bb1))
- First, sort through all the information in the project sub-folder to determine what you’ll use and what can be moved to your hold folder. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/2b057fd4-b119-4b49-820a-22fe06119c3f))
- if a good portion of the information you’ve saved turns out to be irrelevant, this might indicate that you either need to narrow the scope of your project or go back into expansion mode to collect more relevant information ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/85754177-3f51-410b-98fc-ce456a3733ad))
- Next, identify each small task necessary to complete your project, create a subfolder for each task within your project subfolder, and order the subfolders chronologically. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/3179c1b2-7089-4d4f-95e7-a6e7400dfd1a))
- Finally, sort the information and notes within the main project subfolder into the task bundle(s) that they’ll be used for. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/6d40da7b-3d1e-4b60-8653-6b07ea5af7f8))
- Forte also recommends saving and reusing task bundles ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/91f563eb-0d2e-4a63-8dc1-7847e3badb8e))
- Strategy #2: Plan Your Next Session ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/57148ed9-6701-441f-a5b3-b2aab5bac3ca))
- Next, Forte says that at the end of every work session, you should identify the next steps to guide your next work session. ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/72c5551e-94ee-4cbf-9730-5c91651217e8))
- Strategy #3: Prioritize Completion Over Perfection ([View Highlight](https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights/8fc0fa26-a197-4975-a163-b1ed2de313e9))
