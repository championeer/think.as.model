## Highlights
- • **Projects:** Short-term efforts in your work or life that you’re working on now.
  • **Areas:** Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time.
  • **Resources:** Topics or interests that may be useful in the future.
  • **Archives:** Inactive items from the other three categories. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggybydnbyjsgr03t8p15rkgj))
- This order gives us a convenient checklist for deciding where to put a note, starting at the top of the list and moving down:
  1. In which project will this be most useful?
  2. *If none* : In which area will this be most useful?
  3. *If none* : Which resource does this belong to?
  4. *If none* : Place in archives. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggyxjhnjwerxx8jxhvbatg6h))

- In other words, you are always trying to place a note or file not only where it will be useful, but where it will be useful the *soonest* . By placing a note in a project folder, you ensure you’ll see it next time you work on that project. By placing it in an area folder, you’ll come across it next time you’re thinking about that area of your work or life. By placing it in a resource folder, you’ll notice it only if and when you decide to dive into that topic and do some reading or research. By placing it in archives, you never need to see it again unless you want to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ggyvg6hk9d5cf9egdwfr4sxp))
