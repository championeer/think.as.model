## Highlights
- Making a Living as a Fiction Writer
  Summary:
  In an interview with Ryan Holiday, the two of you spoke about how difficult that is getting a foothold in writing fiction versus nonfiction. I'm a full time fiction writer who makes money from self published works. There are more fiction writers making a living through self publishing this way than there are through traditional means. Todd says he can name several authors earning seven figures a year.

  Now I know why this came up in my mind because I'm looking at my notes here. I got an email from someone in response to the Ryan interview from last week. On the Ryan interview last week, I guess at some point Ryan and I were talking about fiction versus nonfiction writing and say, how in fiction writing, it's much harder to get established. It's harder to find an audience. It's harder to make a living as a fiction writer. You sort of either break through in a really big or you can't even get through the door. And I got an email from someone, I have it here named Todd, who was saying, I mean, I'll read it here, but he's saying there is an option I don't know about. It's a little bit underground in the fiction writing world that's actually really powerful. So I want to read this email. I thought it was interesting. So Todd said in your podcast interview with Ryan Holiday, the two of you spoke about how difficult that is getting a foothold in writing fiction versus nonfiction. I'm a full time fiction writer who makes money from self published works. If a fiction writer is able to one, write a lot and consistently between two to 10,000 words a day and two, knows how to write to a specific market or genre. In my case, I write to the niche of progression fantasy. There is a clear path to making a living at this by releasing lots of books to your market. It is not a sure path nor is it the only path, but there are more fiction writers making a living through self publishing this way than there are through traditional means. Todd says, I'm earning low six figures at the moment, but off the top of my head, I can name several authors earning seven figures a year. He names Amanda Lee, Mark Dawson, Will White, Sean Silver's and Michael Andrell and more. What these authors have in common is that you probably haven't heard of them unless you're an avid reader in their genres. That's interesting. So there's this whole world of self published books and really narrow genres where you publish a lot. So like multiple books a year and people are killing it.
