- Study tip:
  üìù Take notes after reading, not during.
  Do you stop every few sentences to scribble something down?
  Bad move! Stop interrupting yourself.
  Instead:
  1) Read a chapter or section.
  2) Explain the main ideas in your own words.
  You remember what you grok. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rroudt/status/1625525960660635649))
- **Never Run Out of Content Ideas With the Two-Year Test**
  My favorite ideation framework is the Two-Year Test by <a href="https://twitter.com/dickiebush">@dickiebush</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77">@Nicolascole77</a>.
  It helps to:
  ‚Ä¢ Find your topics.
  ‚Ä¢ Make them specific.
  ‚Ä¢ Brainstorm useful content.
  Here's how I use it:
  -------
  **Where were you two years ago?**
  -------
  *‚ÄúEveryone is an expert in something,‚Äù* as Dickie and Cole like to say. It‚Äôs also the premise of the Two-Year Test.
  No matter where you are in life, your previous life experiences make you an expert on some very narrow topics.
  Take me as an example. I was an obese guy in my twenties, using food to still the pain of my traumas. I liked to party and eat out. And I was stuck in my ways.
  Only when I discovered people like myself and started listening to their advice did I change positively.
  Over the past years, I‚Äôve learned to face my pains and deal with them more healthily with the help of Stoicism. 
  I‚Äôm not the world‚Äôs top expert on weight-loss or Stoicism, but I can share my experiences and help guys like myself ‚Äî just like how those guys on random internet forums helped me years ago.
  What matters is that I'm able to help people who are a few steps behind me on the same path.
  Likewise, you are an expert at something. Anything. So ask yourself:
  ‚Ä¢ What skills have I learned?
  ‚Ä¢ What problems have I overcome?
  ‚Ä¢ What hobbies have I gotten into?
  ‚Ä¢ What life transitions have I experienced?
  Ideas will start flowing once you see what broad topics you‚Äôre an expert at. But to never run out of ideas, you‚Äôll have to dig deeper:
  **-------**
  **Get specific for more ideas**
  -------
  Paradoxically, the more specific you get with your content, the more ideas you‚Äôll get.
  For years, I tried to write for everybody and cram multiple ideas into every piece I wrote. Not only did I make writing much harder, but I also started to run out of ideas.
  Until I niched down.
  Dickie and Cole recommend to take our broad topic and make it as specific as possible. We can do that by thinking of:
  ‚Ä¢ Money
  ‚Ä¢ Problem
  ‚Ä¢ Industry
  ‚Ä¢ Location
  ‚Ä¢ Situation
  ‚Ä¢ Experience
  ‚Ä¢ Demographic
  For example, when I started to write about my philosophical journey, my audience was my past self. But that wasn‚Äôt a ‚ÄúNorthern European guy in his twenties who‚Äôs obese.‚Äù While good at first sight, it's too broad.
  So, I wrote for a more specific persona:
  ‚Ä¢ A single guy in his twenties;
  ‚Ä¢ Making $100,000+ a year from a corporate job;
  ‚Ä¢ Used to the (hedonistic) good life but seeing the emptiness of it in recent months/years;
  ‚Ä¢ Intrigued by history and ancient philosophies.
  That better described me, and getting specific helped me picture an actual person while writing. Most people couldn't relate to me, but those who did were magnetically attracted to my content.
  So, who is *your* specific persona?
  -------
  **Describe your path and proven approach**
  -------
  Getting content ideas becomes easy when you know who you‚Äôre writing to.
  But to never run out of ideas, Dickie and Cole recommend we think about four types of content:
  **Actionable content**
  This type of content is the most popular and valuable. It‚Äôs also what most people buy. For example:
  ‚Ä¢ Tips
  ‚Ä¢ Tools
  ‚Ä¢ Resources
  ‚Ä¢ Frameworks
  ‚Ä¢ Curation (best of)
  **Analytical content**
  This type of content breaks down what other people created and draws lessons from it. For example:
  ‚Ä¢ Trends
  ‚Ä¢ Numbers
  ‚Ä¢ Examples
  ‚Ä¢ Teardowns
  ‚Ä¢ Inspiration (swipe files)
  **Aspirational content**
  This type of content makes people feel like they can do what you did. For example:
  ‚Ä¢ Lessons
  ‚Ä¢ Mistakes
  ‚Ä¢ Reflections
  ‚Ä¢ Personal stories
  ‚Ä¢ Underrated traits
  **Antropological content**
  This type of content describes why things are the way they are. For example:
  ‚Ä¢ Fears
  ‚Ä¢ Failures
  ‚Ä¢ Paradoxes
  ‚Ä¢ Observations
  ‚Ä¢ Comparisons
  I recommend you take a peaceful moment to journal about your ideal persona and come back to it often.
  -------
  **Recap and what‚Äôs next**
  -------
  That‚Äôs more than enough for today. Let‚Äôs recap what we‚Äôve covered in this lesson:
  ‚Ä¢ **You are an expert.** There‚Äôs always something you‚Äôve learned in the past two years that‚Äôs obvious to you but could be amazing to others.
  ‚Ä¢ **Write for a specific person.** The more you zoom in on the one person you write for, the more content ideas you‚Äôll get. Ignore this paradox at your peril.
  ‚Ä¢ **Mix up your content types.** You can write about a single topic from multiple angles. From actionable ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù content to philosophical ‚Äúwhy‚Äù pieces, the more specific you get, the more ideas you‚Äôll have.
  Tomorrow, we‚Äôll use our persona as a starting point for ‚Äúsales safari,‚Äù so please take the time to consider who you want to write for:
  -------
  **Prompt: Describe yourself from two years ago**
  -------
  As always, let‚Äôs learn from each other (and maybe even find like-minded people):
  ***Who is the person you (will) write for?***
  Please take a few minutes to reflect on what you‚Äôve learned in the past two years. Think of a problem you faced, where you lived, your financial situation, and other things that made your problem uniquely yours.
  More likely than not, there are people *right now* who have the same problems and would love to learn from you.
  Share your persona description as a comment, and maybe your persona will read it and reach out!
  I hope to read from you.

  This year, I'm writing and publishing one email course *per week*.
  My goal is to create a complete curriculum for creators wanting to produce life-changing email courses. That means that a lot of supporting skills like storytelling, automation, and instructional design are going to get a lot of attention.
