- The Resistance Paradox
  When we accept resistance, resistance disappears. 
  When we accept our challenges, we’re able to start solving them.
  When we face the fire, the fire can be extinguished.
  Our resistance is an opportunity, or an ever-growing thorn in our side. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1600131757701046274))
- Introspection Illusion
  We think we understand our motivations and desires, our likes and dislikes. 
  We believe we know ourselves and why we are the way we are.
  In reality, when asked to explain our emotional states, we typically make something up.
  Dig deeper, reflect more. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1600131760997687296))
- Focalism
  We place too much focus or emphasis on a single factor or piece of information when making judgments or predictions.
  “Nothing in life is quite as important as you think it is while you are thinking about it.”
  Step back, welcome alternative data, and then decide. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1600131763229134849))
- Moral Credential Effect
  Greater confidence and security in our self-image tend to make us worry less about the consequences of immoral behavior.
  This makes us more likely to make immoral choices.
  Remember: No one individual is ever above the human condition. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1600131765414264833))
- Time-Saving Bias
  We misestimate the time that could be saved (or lost) when increasing (or decreasing) speed.
  Speeding in a car over a short distance doesn’t actually save that much time. 
  Lesson: Always consider the influence and importance of speed on your outcome. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1600131767322771456))
- Wait, What?
  A method to avoid jumping to conclusions or making snap judgements. 
  When someone presents an idea, opinion, or a belief, ask "Wait, What?"
  It reminds you to slow down.
  To make sure you truly understand and can respond thoughtfully.

- Luck Razor
  If stuck with 2 equal options, pick the one that feels like it will produce the most luck later down the line.
  Should I stay in tonight or should I go and meet this interesting stranger?
  Choose to increase your surface area of luck when you have the choice. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1600131775619031041))
- 10/10/10 Rule
  We're all guilty of making decisions without thinking about long term consequences.
  To avoid this, ask:
  • How will I feel about this 10 minutes from now?
  • 10 months from now?
  • 10 years from now?
  This helps clarify the decision that results in a win/win/win. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1600131777808457728))
- Do Nothing Tendency
  We are more bothered by harm that comes from action than harm that comes from inaction, so we default to no action.
  "Most of us have two lives: the life we live, and the unlived life within us"— 
  @SPressfield
  Don't resort to no action as a means of comfort. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1600131779880443905))
- The Knowing Paradox
  The more you admit you don’t know, the more you will know.
  It’s the curiosity and humility to admit you don’t know that allows you to ask the questions that lead to knowing.
  A willingness to look dumb in the moment makes you smarter tomorrow. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1600131782447439873))
- That's a wrap!
