- First, why it works:
  "It works by activating the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our rest and digest mode,
  while switching off the sympathetic nervous system, which triggers our stress response (or fight or flight mode)."

- Here’s how to do 4-7-8 breathing:
  1. Breathe in through your nose for a 4-second count.
  2. Hold your breath for a 7-second count.
  3. Exhale for an 8-second count, making a "whoosh" sound through pursed lips. 
  4. Repeat up to four times, twice per day. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SystemSunday/status/1577635467670994944))
- Simple, but powerful advice.
  Doing 4-7-8 breathing before you fall asleep is just one use case.
  You can use 4-7-8 at any time to alleviate stress.
  In fact, Dr. Weil recommends practicing the technique twice per day to hone the skill (and see long-lasting benefits). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SystemSunday/status/1577635469206163456))
- That’s it—the 4-7-8 breathing technique for a zen-like mind.
  Dr. Weil describes it as "a natural tranquilizer for the nervous system."
