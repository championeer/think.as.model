## Highlights
- 10 Mental Concepts To Make You Smarter: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1499438248732639237))
- Recency Illusion
  The belief that things you have noticed only recently are in fact recent—or have only just come into existence 
  "Whoa, that's new to me. It must be new to the world!"
  When we think something is new, we treat it as new, and therefore miss important context ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1499438256240353285))
- Anthropomorphism
  The attribution of human traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human things—it helps us make sense of the behaviours and events we encounter
  However, perceiving the presence of human qualities in other entities can be misleading when such qualities are absent ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1499438258685714448))
- Essentialism
  The belief that groups of people, such as men and women, have different basic characteristics that cannot be changed and that are necessary to their identity
  Beware of this belief as it can lead to rigid thinking and perception of our surrounding environment ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1499438261034442759))
- Cheerleader Effect
  The cognitive bias which causes people to think individuals are more attractive when they are in a group
  Arises from a tendency of the mind to not process every individual detail they perceive, but rather summarise or categorise information as a group ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1499438263295258626))
- Mental Accounting
  A tendency to place different values on the same amount of money, based on subjective criteria, often with detrimental results
  Helps explain why people are willing to spend more when they pay with a credit card than cash ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1499438266004692995))
- Appeal To Probability Fallacy
  Asserting that since something is probably the case, it is certainly the case
  “If I keep doing this long enough, I will probably succeed; therefore, I will succeed.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1499438268286447621))
- Magic Number (7+-2)
  The average person can only keep 7 ± 2 items in their short-term working memory
  Humans can process finite information. Information overload will lead to distraction that negatively affects performance 
  When conveying information, limit it to the essentials ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1499438270576484353))
- Swimmer's Body Illusion
  Confusing traits with results
  We think we can get the body of a professional swimmer by swimming a lot.
  In truth, the swimmer is able to reach a professional level due to already having the ‘right’ body
  We should identify and play to our strengths

- Streetlight Effect
  People tend to get their information from where it’s easiest to look
  E.g. We use the first page of Google search results for the majority of research regrdless of how factual the results are. Cumulatively, this can skew knowlege in an entire field ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1499438292500156421))
- Planning Fallacy
  A tendency to underestimate the time it will take to complete a future task, despite knowledge that previous tasks have taken longer than planned
  Occurs due to an optimisim bias ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1499438295650127874))
- That's a wrap!
