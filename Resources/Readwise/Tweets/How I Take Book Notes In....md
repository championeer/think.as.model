## Highlights
- How I take book notes in <a href="https://twitter.com/obsdmd">@obsdmd</a> and retain the information I read.
  My entire process, from start to finish.

- Everything starts off with the book. 
  I have just started reading Million Dollar Weekend by <a href="https://twitter.com/noahkagan">@noahkagan</a>, so let's use that as the example. 
  I prefer physical books, but that is personal preference.

- When reading the book, I will highlight snippets and take notes throughout. I mark the sections I want to revisit with sticky tabs. 
  I will usually read the whole book before turning anything digital. 
  When the book is finished, I revisit the sections I highlighted and then begin moving them across to my vault. 
  This manual process is actually why I prefer physical books. You are forced to revisit highlights and manually copy them over to a digital vault, and I believe this small amount of friction is an important step of making sure you are truly copying what resonates.<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GGTjRs9WQAAqCIS.jpg'/> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jameesy/status/1757786462290866352))
- Whenever I start reading a book, I create a new page for it in daily notes. 
  I prefix book notes with a 'B.' so I know it is a book at a glance. 
  I like creating this in daily notes, so I can catch context and sentiment around why I started reading this book. 
  Sometimes there has been a specific reason for me picking a book, and it's nice to know when I have finished whether it answered any questions I had before reading.<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GGTlrsUX0AAlaeI.png'/> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jameesy/status/1757786467982606781))
- As with all my notes, I use my tagging system as metadata for searchability. 
  The note sits within a dedicated resources folder in my 'Commonplace' folder.

- I structure my book notes in this format.
  I have a 'key points' section which are a few key lessons that I have taken from the book. 
  I then have notes, and this is where I copy the majority of my highlights and marginalia. 
  As you see, I create new notes from key ideas...

- The below example is the quote we highlighted in the book originally. 
  This is 'atomic' information, in that it is not only relevant to the Million Dollar Weekend book. This is why it forms it's own note.
  I have the original context of where it came from in the linked mentions, but I can create new links from this piece of information.<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GGTo8xcXQAAuVQE.jpg'/> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/jameesy/status/1757786485862850630))
