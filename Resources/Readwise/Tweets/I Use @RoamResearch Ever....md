## Highlights
- I use @RoamResearch every single day for #productmanagement. I thought some people might like to see how I handle one of the key elements of the product discovery process: questions. A #productmgmt ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MDThogerson/status/1475889012665507840))
- If you work in #product you know that a high % of your day-to-day involves questions. Whether you are answering these questions yourself or trying to get others to answer them for you, you need to be able to track questions and answers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MDThogerson/status/1475889013810597889))
- When I have a discovery question I will write it down in Roam as a TODO. Generally it will look like this:

- Where this gets really powerful is that every question is tagged, well, as a question. I do this so I can see it easily on any page I'm looking at - but also because it consolidates it in the [[question]] page. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MDThogerson/status/1475889019477106696))
- On the question page I put together a query that returns all questions that also are "undone" or - in other words - still in the TODO status. This gives me a list of questions to get answers for.

- (If you're not leveraging queries in #roamresearch you absolutely should be - it's a huge time saver.) In this use case, helps clear the noise and directs me to only the loose threads in my #discovery. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MDThogerson/status/1475889024082448389))
- When I answer a question I mark the question as DONE (important) but also nest the answer beneath the question and flag it with the #[[answer]] tag. (Generally I also tag who gave me the answer - and the date if it's not on my daily notes page.)

- This gives me some awesome flexibility for my curious future-self. First I can go to the question page and then filter out any questions that are marked as DONE: this shows me all the questions I have yet to get answered. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MDThogerson/status/1475889028062871556))
- Secondly: I can go to my #[[answer]] page and then see an interconnected thread of answers I've gotten, who provided them, and then what the original question was. 
  And naturally those answer are interconnected with themes and concepts in #productdiscovery. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MDThogerson/status/1475889029094670338))
