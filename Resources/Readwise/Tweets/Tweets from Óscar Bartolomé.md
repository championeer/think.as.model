## Highlights
- ðŸš¨ J**USTICE LEAGUE BAROQUE PROMPT SHARE ðŸš¨
  **Yesterday I shared a prompt for a Ju**stice League p**oster and wallpaper.
  Today I'm going to share a similar, but more original, prompt. I have used the style of painters such as Ca**ravaggio and Rubens. **And I must say that their baroque style fits well with the superhero theme.
  You have each prompt in the ALT of the images. Give it a try, and I assure you that you will come up with something astonishing every time ðŸ¤¯
  Which of the two styles do you like better, the one in yesterday's post or this one?
  P.S*.: As we already know, Midjourney mixes characters, such as Batman and Superman.

- ðŸš¨ P**ADME AMIDALA NIJI PROMPT SHARE **ðŸš¨
  As I announced this afternoon, I present you the Niji version of Pa**dme Amidala.
  **
  But to spice it up a bit, I wanted to show her with a bl**aster.
  **
  And here's the kicker, because by inserting the blaster token at the prompt, the beautiful queen of Naboo turns to the dark side and allies herself with the St**ormTroopers ðŸ˜†
  **
  The prompt is sure to look familiar (it's a trademark of the house ðŸ™‚):
  padm*e amidala with blasters, in the style of mark brooks, photorealistic scenes, detailed comic book art, epic, rtx on, daz3d, animated illustrations, digital art techniques, intense full body --s 1000 --niji 5 --ar *9:16*
  Th*e outcomes, as you will see, are extremely diverse, and sometimes she also appears with a lightsaber.
  And it doesn't end there. Tomorrow I will publish another version that deserves its own space.
  Enjoy it.
