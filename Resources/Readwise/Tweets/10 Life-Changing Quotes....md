- 1. "Humans are basically habit machines. I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta-skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wise_chimp/status/1438858906479079426))
- 2. "Habits are good. Habits can allow you to background process certain things so that your neocortex, your frontal lobe, stays available to solve brand new problems." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wise_chimp/status/1438858911549902851))
- 3. "When building habits, choose consistency over content. The best book is the one you canâ€™t put down. The best exercise is the one you enjoy doing every day. The best health food is the one you find tasty. The best work is the work youâ€™d do for free."

- 4. "Changing habits: 
  Pick one thing. Cultivate a desire. Visualize it. Plan a sustainable path. Identify needs, triggers, & substitutes. Tell your friends. Track meticulously. Self-discipline is a bridge to a new self-image. Bake in the new self-image. Itâ€™s who you are, now." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wise_chimp/status/1438858939148423169))
- 5. "Breaking habits is a skill, and it is something you can learn. Start with a small habit and try different techniques to break it. Try substituting. Try going cold turkey. Try weaning yourself off. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wise_chimp/status/1438858942935932935))
- Try social proof by telling other people that youâ€™re going to break the habit. Try putting other habits around it that leave no time for that habit. Try removing the triggers. Try toning down the rewards. Do whatever it takes but break one bad habit this year." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wise_chimp/status/1438858946803118080))
- 6. "All the benefits in life come from compound interest - relationship, money, habits - anything of importance." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wise_chimp/status/1438858950577999877))
- 7. "Although you can read tons of books on it (changing habits), the reality is youâ€™re never going to learn how to break bad habits until you just break them." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wise_chimp/status/1438858954243719172))
- 8. "One thing I try to do is I try to break a bad habit every six months, and I try and pick up a good habit every six months to year." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wise_chimp/status/1438858957997678595))
- 9. "To some extent, our attitude in life, our mood, our happiness levels, depression levels, these are also habits." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wise_chimp/status/1438858961495724040))
- 10. "Fast, lift, sprint, stretch, and meditate. Build, sell, write, create, invest, and own. Read, reflect, love, seek truth, and ignore society. Make these habits. Say no to everything else. Avoid debt, jail, addiction, disgrace, shortcuts, and media. Relax. Victory is assured." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/wise_chimp/status/1438858965283229699))
