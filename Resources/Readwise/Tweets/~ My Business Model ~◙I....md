## Highlights
- ~ My Business Model ~
  I write, tweet, podcast, teach, and invest. Here's how my media engine fits together.
  Solid lines = The current flywheel
  Dotted lines = The future flywheel
  For an explanation of every element and my vision for the future, read the thread below.

- 1. Twitter
  The vast majority of people find me on Twitter. It's the town square of the Internet and an always-on conference where I make friends, grow my audience, and share what's on my mind. 
  Twitter is the top of the funnel for my professional life. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1413995759389876227))
- 2. Essays
  Long-form writing is my favorite art form. It's the hardest thing I do, but also the most rewarding.
  When I started writing, I focused on publishing as much as possible, which helped me find my voice. Now I’m focused on publishing essays that stand the test of time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1413995760367058950))
- 3. Podcasts
  I have two podcasts: (1) The North Star Podcast where I interview interesting people, and (2) The Write of Passage Podcast where I talk about the basics of online writing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1413995761285599232))
- 4. YouTube
  I publish shorts and a video essay every week. I’ve also been hosting workshops with my favorite creators like @shl, @anthilemoon, and @jackbutcher.
  I use YouTube to explore my main interests: writing, education, the Western canon, creativity, and entrepreneurship. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1413995762241900546))
- 5. Email Subscribers
  Email is the linchpin of my professional life. I send out two weekly newsletters: Monday Musings and Friday Finds. One is a collection of the coolest things I learned every week, and in the other, I share my favorite links. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1413995763206610944))
- 6. Writing School
  Write of Passage, my 5-week online course, is my main revenue stream. More than 1,000 people have now graduated from the program, and we just launched our first spin-off course: The Writing Studio. 
  Ultimately, we are going to turn it into a business school. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1413995764276211715))
- 7. Angel Investing
  I invest in companies that help people become Citizens of the Internet. Most of the ones I’ve invested in are focused on productivity, education, and the creator economy — the three areas where I can help founders the most.

- 8. Book
  These next two are about the future. 
  I'm thinking about my first book, which will probably be about writing online and becoming a citizen of the Internet. I'm already in talks with agents, editors, traditional publishers and non-traditional ones. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1413995766474018825))
- 9. The Vision
  Ultimately, I want to build a collection of Audience-First Products.
  They'll be software-based and focused on writing, business, and education. All of them will be under the Write of Passage umbrella. Beyond that, time will tell!

- I plan to re-write this thread every couple of years to document how things are changing.
  My vision is increasingly centered around online writing. I didn’t realize how big the market was when I started and I love teaching Write of Passage.
