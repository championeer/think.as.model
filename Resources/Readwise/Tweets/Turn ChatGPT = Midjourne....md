## Highlights
- Turn ChatGPT = Midjourney Prompt Machine
  Let's see if we can get GPT4 to make or average prompts and turn them into "voyage inspirant" type mastery prompts.
  Hint, they will include words such as "adorned", "enchanting", "attire", "ethereal", "illuminated"...
  üßµ A thread

- Let's start with this prompt from Midjourney V4
  This is already quite a verbose prompt for MJV4.
  Now let's run it through my little magic ChatGPT prompt.
  Hold on to my beer.

- I mean, this is a work of art, and like that second sentence we spot the word "adorned" right their in plain sight. I see you GPT4 vocabulary.
  We can also spot a few other words like, celestial, harmonious, illuminated for sure is there.
  Now how will Midjourney translate this?

- Just making sure you see what I see. The ChatGPT GPT4 prompt is working its magic.

- ‚ú® Superfluous Output
  It came out well, however my Scandinavian white walls are gone. I did get a nice interior image, I'll grant you that.

- ‚ú® More Superfluous Outputs
  Actually lets look at the first roll, we ended up getting 2 bedrooms in that set.
  Let's re-roll and see what we end up with.
  This is plain experimentation as I'm writing this thread.

- ‚ú® More Superfluous Outputs
  Second re-roll gave me also 50/50 bedroom, livingroom. And not much of that original looks is left.
  Time to deep dive that prompt and see whats going on in the 2000 chars or so. 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FtIel-jacAAEfIb.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LinusEkenstam/status/1644410466398265347))
- Ahhh no where in the new prompt do we actually say we want a living room, let's sort that out.
  This is some strange prompting, but we will get there, do not fret. 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FtIem-laIAAJHMh.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LinusEkenstam/status/1644410477794172928))
- First sentence changed to:
  "In the serene sanctuary of a livingroom::2"
  Putting emphasis on Livingroom with the ::2 weight.
  and added to the end
  :: Scandinavian Interior Design

- Now we are back in business, we got some pretty slick looking photos. Now to the billion dollar question. Do we really need this prompt with gated, hard to grasp, nonsensical words?
  Let's figure it out.

- So by using /describe on our image. We can clearly see how Midjourney does not actually think using 2000 chars is beneficial. Let's just take one of these options, without edits and see what we get.

- Voila! Dead simple dynamic prompt.
  üí¨ Elegant modern grey living room, in the style of high quality photo, naturalistic rendering, soft, muted color palette, uhd image, everyday life, oversized objects, contemporary diy --ar 3:2 --v 5 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FtIepuxaUAAOMFo.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LinusEkenstam/status/1644410524459991040))
- If you still want to make very extensive prompts from the simplest of prompts, you can still use my ChatGPT GPT4 prompt
  üí¨ ‚ÄúRe-write the text to be more verbose and include a lot of superfluous description about each thing, use very painting language‚Äù 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FtIeqUWagAEjYXa.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LinusEkenstam/status/1644410533607800832))
- Let's try this one last time for the fun of it.
  Two prompts,
  1Ô∏è‚É£ A photograph of a flower --ar 2:3 --v5
  2Ô∏è‚É£ The long one below... to long for alt. 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FtIeq3PaIAETepa.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/LinusEkenstam/status/1644410541430161408))
- While left actually shows me a photo of a flower. The right shows something between real and art, so I think there is merit to using this prompt transformer of mine. If you want to experiment.
  Left = standard prompt
  Right = superfluous prompt
