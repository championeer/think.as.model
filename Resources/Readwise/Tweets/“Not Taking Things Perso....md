## Highlights
- “Not taking things personally is a superpower.” —James Clear
  5 mental models to develop thick skin: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SystemSunday/status/1610267282394972161))
- 1. Spotlight Effect (Cognitive Bias)
  We think people are paying far more attention to us than they are.
  Harsh truth:
  Your freedom begins the day you realize nobody is thinking about you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SystemSunday/status/1610267283896651783))
- 2. The ‘Procedure or Perception’ Razor
  When you receive negative feedback, ask yourself:
  - Should I change my procedure (actions I take)?
  - Or should I change my perception (how I interpret the advice)?
  Avoid constructive feedback from people who’ve never constructed anything. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SystemSunday/status/1610267285855559681))
- 3. The 10% Hater Rule
  The other day I received a comment that I was “toxically positive.”
  It reminded me of this quote I love:
  “10% of people will find a way to take anything personally. Expect it and treat it as math.” —Tim Ferriss ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SystemSunday/status/1610267287541489664))
- 4. Growth Mindset
  A growth mindset is a belief that you CAN improve your abilities through dedication + hard work.
  Mastery takes time (for everyone).
  Commit yourself to lifelong learning. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SystemSunday/status/1610267289252773893))
- 5. No is Normal
  Paul Mitchell sold encyclopedias door-to-door before becoming a billionaire (from Patrón and hair products).
  Life is a numbers game.
  Today's winners often got rejected the most (but persevered).
  Keep taking shots on goal; eventually, you will break through. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SystemSunday/status/1610267290855182336))
- Those were 5 concepts to develop thick skin.
  One final thought:
  “Trying to get everyone to like you is a sign of mediocrity.” —Colin Powell
