## Highlights
- **6 Project Management Rules That Every Product Manager Should Know**
  #3 is by far the hardest to master, for me at least.
  **1. Clearly Define Scope and Objectives**
  Before starting a project, clearly define its scope, objectives, and deliverables. 
  This clarity helps in aligning the team's efforts and avoiding scope creep, which can derail projects.
  **2. Plan but Stay Flexible**
  While thorough planning is essential, it's equally important to stay flexible. 
  Be prepared to adapt your plan in response to new insights, changing market conditions, or unexpected challenges.
  **3. Effective Stakeholder Communication**
  Regularly communicate with all stakeholders, including team members, executives, and other departments. 
  Clear, concise, and frequent communication helps in managing expectations and keeps everyone aligned with the project's progress.
  **4. Prioritize and Delegate**
  As a product manager, you need to prioritize tasks based on their impact and urgency. 
  Delegate effectively to ensure that you and your team are focusing on the right tasks at the right time.
  **5. Risk Management** 
  Identify potential risks early in the project and develop mitigation strategies. 
  Proactive risk management can prevent small issues from becoming project-threatening problems.
  **6. Review and Learn from Each Project** 
  After completing a project, conduct a review to identify what went well and what could be improved. 
  Learning from each project helps in continuously refining your project management skills.<img src='https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GDkVKX8b0AA-zwz.jpg'/> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/KhodorMahmoud/status/1745449613216420042))
