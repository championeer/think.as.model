## Highlights
- All these ChatGPT-4 threads are a joke.
  The best AI writing prompts aren't 1 sentence. That's like having a Ferrari and driving it 5 mph.
  Here's a 60-second masterclass on how to create prompts like a virtuoso writer:

- 1) Create constraints. Don't encourage assumptions.
  If you give AI vague information, it will give you a vague conclusion.
  If you ask it a broad question, it will give you a broad answer.
  People who say ChatGPT "creates mediocre content" are giving it mediocre prompts.

- 2) Treat AI like a "Digital Intern" and invest in its training.
  If you hired an intern tomorrow, you wouldn't give him/her 1 sentence of direction.
  You'd...
  • Create a checklist
  • Explain why
  • Ask if he/she has any questions
  Do the same with ChatGPT.

- 3) You do the "thinking." Tell AI how to "do the doing."
  You can't expect AI to think for you.
  Instead, whatever you want AI to help you create, you need to first understand:
  • Why you want what you want
  • What, specifically, you need
  • How you want it delivered

- 4) Talk to AI like a human, and only give it 1 task at a time.
  • You can ask AI if it's confused.
  • You can tell AI to "do that again."
  The best prompts don't ask AI to chase 7 different ideas at once.
  Remember: imagine you're hand-holding a college intern.

- 5) If AI gives you the wrong output, that means you gave it the wrong input.
  Don't get upset at AI (lol).
  Sometimes, you need to workshop your prompts 10+ times to figure out how to get what you need.
  Even though you're writing English, think of it like you're writing code. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1637801786776997893))
- In short:
  If you don't know what to ask for, AI isn't going to know what to give you.
  Which is why the thesis "the robots are taking over... we're all going to lose our jobs!" is wrong.
  If you're a do-er, you need to become a "thinker."
  So you can tell AI to "do the doing." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1637801787947114496))
