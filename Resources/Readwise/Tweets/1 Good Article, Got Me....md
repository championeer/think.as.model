## Highlights
- 1/ Good article, got me to thinking. This for me hits on the fact that #TfT tools, despite their history of research & recent implementation attempts, its all in its infancy. 
  Example 1: Backlinks are great until you have 80 :-). This is true in Roam, Obsidian, LogSeq, Craft. https://t.co/68kmsUc5C8 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1492561325465157634))
- 2/ The challenge long-term for these tool vendors is how to make these things more useful to us. How to resurface in a useful way, and not overwhelm us.
  This is the value we want from these tools. We already had Notepad and Evernote, we are asking for much more. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1492561327373619210))
- 3/ Example 2: graph view. We know we need the ability to visualize our data to understand its complexity and relationships. 
  Roam gave us a taste, Obsidian is better, but Roam Portal from @DharamKapila goes light years further and shows us a broader potential. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1492561328887803906))
- 4/ We have a long way to go. We only got a taste of the possibilities.
  Having said that, I am also hopeful that the new generation of plugins coming along will help us experiment with these concepts (obsidian examples: breadcrumbs, graph analysis). 
  So its not just on vendors. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1492561330225790980))
- 5/ For #TfT crowd on Twitter, many of us are willing to experiment and realize its a journey. 
  But for Joe Schmoe paying $15 a month for a tool that is going to help him in his thinking might not feel the value, as after some time it under delivers as this article points out. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1492561331609911296))
- 6/ Note-taking is at the core. But features that make notes come alive still need lots of experimentation.
  Some will stay for the ride. Others will not have the patience - can’t blame them. 
  When you pay for tools, you expect vendors to deliver value equivalent to what you pay. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1492561334633963527))
