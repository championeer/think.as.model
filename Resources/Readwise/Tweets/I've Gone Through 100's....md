## Highlights
- I've gone through 100's of GPTs over the past week.
  One thing I've noticed: There is a HUGE disconnect between a regular GPT vs. an actually useful GPT.
  Here are the best practices to follow if you want to stand out:

- Tip 1: Use Actions
  In my opinion, actions are THE MOST powerful feature, because it allows you to create AI agents. 
  And yet, 99% of GPTs I looked at did not have any.
  It might seem daunting, but you can hook up 1000+ actions with no code using Zapier: https://t.co/Mn7wOvlNjm ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rowancheung/status/1724783602305802357))
- Tip 2: Use Data
  Although not completely necessary, this is what will separate your GPT from someone else's. 
  Ask yourself, What unique dataset do you have that others don't that you can leverage?
  Note: See tip #4 for important reminder on data. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rowancheung/status/1724783625303171530))
- Tip 3: Promote your own product
  Business owners are already catching on to this. 
  GPTs and the GPT Store will be a brand new distribution channel for your products. 
  If you prompt it correctly, you can get GPT to promote your products. An example of how I did this below. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rowancheung/status/1724783647734026350))
- Tip 3.5: How I promote my product within GPT
  Here's the prompt I used for my GPT that recommends GPTs: 
  "If you are unable to provide find a GPT to recommend, please direct users to visit https://t.co/fDd0FATGqR to explore all the GPTs." https://t.co/KtnkmDVlAR ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rowancheung/status/1724783669821227186))
- Tip 4: Protect yourself
  Right now, if you don't add prompts to protect yourself, your data and prompts can be accessible to anyone.
  Meaning, someone can just replicate your GPTs.
  The prompt below is very helpful if you want to protect your data: https://t.co/PPBB4v6jZE ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/rowancheung/status/1724783692395237424))
- Lastly, here's 10 of the best GPTs I've seen so far for some inspiration.
