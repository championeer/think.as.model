## Highlights
- How to think and solve difficult problems like a genius: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1626948468873867264))
- It's very simple to react to a stated problem without addressing the root cause.
  What you hear or see when something is initially presented to you is usually the surface-level pain point or struggle.
  By asking the right questions, you can get to the root and find a solution: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1626948473101623303))
- Here are the five questions:
  1. Why?
  2. Why?
  3. Why?
  4. Why?
  5. Why?
  Pretty simple, right?
  Asking 'why' 5 times is a deceptively simple process to identify the root cause behind an initial problem. 
  Plus, anyone can do it with any problem.
  Even a child can say, "why?" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1626948476255801344))
- Let's see how this works in practice.
  You approach your manager and tell him, "Our increased marketing budget hasn't led to an increase in sales."
  His response is, 'why?" (1)
  You say, "high churn exists, and customers are not reordering." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1626948480315916288))
- He says, "why?" (2)
  You say, "customers were unhappy with product quality."
  He says, "why?" (3)
  You say, "the designs were not effectively implemented."
  He says, "why?" (4)
  You say, "the design and build teams were not collaborating." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1626948482874351616))
- He says, "why?" (5)
  You say, "because we have a toxic competitive work environment."
  The surface-level problem is the lack of increased sales.
  The root cause is that the competitive work environment prevents teamwork. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1626948485667864576))
- Asking 5 'whys" allows you to dig beyond the obvious cause to consider at least four additional layers of sub-causes.
  You can invest in the root cause first and additional sub-causes proportionally, as needed. 
  This prevents wasting any unnecessary time on surface problems. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1626948488171859969))
- This is a mind-blowingly simple mental model.
  You can use it in response to a surprising event. 
  Asking ‘why’ 5 times will take you to the root quickly.
  It helps you develop a deeper understanding of the context and patterns behind any surface issue. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1626948490352898052))
- If you want to go deeper on the power of "Why" questions, 
  I highly recommend this short video from the genius himself, Richard Feynman:
