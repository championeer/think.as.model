## Highlights
- Silicon Valley Bank just lost $80B+ in 24 hours.
  Here's the crazy story (explained simply):

- Some quick stats in case you're unfamiliar with SVB:
  â€¢ $190 BILLION in deposits (2021)
  â€¢ Works with 50%+ of VC-funded startups
  â€¢ Bought $80B in Mortgage-Backed Securities
  Now customers are rushing to get their money out.
  Here's what happened: ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianFOConnor/status/1634185088354201605))
- CEO, Greg Becker looks at SVB's finances.
  He's tense.
  You see, last year, SVB bought $80B in Mortgage Backed Securities.
  That worked until the US Government put their business in a tailspin. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianFOConnor/status/1634185091340443652))
- The gov't raised the return that you get from buying gov't bonds.
  So which would you rather buy?
  1) SVB's Mortgage-Backed Securities:
  â€¢ Risky
  â€¢ Low return
  2) US Gov't Bonds:
  â€¢ Zero-risk
  â€¢ 2.5x the return of SVB
  #2 Right?
  So SVB's value falls fast. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianFOConnor/status/1634185094343663617))
- Greg needs a change to keep SVB alive.
  So he decides to build a safety net - cash
  In 2 moves:
  1) Sell some of their portfolio
  2) Sell shares of SVB
  Normally that wouldn't be a big deal
  But they don't know that a business in San Diego is failing
  And will take SVB down with it ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianFOConnor/status/1634185097292259328))
- That business is Silvergate Bank
  One of the most important banks in crypto
  But its biggest client just failed:
  FTX
  The FTX crash caused customers to pull $8B from Silvergate in January
  So on March 8th, Silvergate closes its doors
  The same day SVB announces its safety net... ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianFOConnor/status/1634185100169445379))
- Greg is proud of the announcement,
  He gave the business a cash injection:
  â€¢ Sold SVB equity to raise cash
  â€¢ Sold $21B in assets
  His head of PR posts the press release:
  https://t.co/XC47BmGvnA
  They prepare for questions
  But never dream customers could react the way they do ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianFOConnor/status/1634185103109660673))
- The news sends startups into a panic.
  The bank that keeps their cash safe just warned they need a safety net.
  After:
  â€¢ FTX collapse
  â€¢ ~100k tech lay offs
  â€¢ Economic recession fear
  And now Silvergate.
  Customers scramble to save their cash and pull out of SVB. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianFOConnor/status/1634185106163113985))
- The rush to pull cash sends SVB into a tailspin.
  They lose $80B+ overnight.
  And as of this writing, SVB is still in free fall.
  So what can we learn from SVB?

- How customers perceive your action is as valuable as the action itself.
  SVB announced their safety net on the same day as Silvergate's collapse.
  Customers perceived them to be related.
  It cost SVB $80B.
  That same action without Silvergate would have had < 10% the impact. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianFOConnor/status/1634185122541973507))
- Customers are people too.
  With real emotions.
  So if you understand your customer fears, you'll be able to manage their perception.
  Customers feel you understand them and trust you.
  During this economic uncertainty... trust wins. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/BrianFOConnor/status/1634185125410885632))
- That's a wrap!
