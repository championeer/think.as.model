## Highlights
- Copywriting has never been easier.
  Using ChatGPT's internet search feature makes it accessible to everyone.
  I've just created a great prompt for analyzing any web page and doing your copywriting from it ↓

- Start by finding the link to an existing landing page that will serve as a base.
  Try to take one that you know is effective and that converts visitors into leads or customers.
  Then use my (big) prompt below which will analyze the structure and marketing in depth: <video controls><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1731348508165177344/pu/vid/avc1/462x360/uFhjDKX6xsEQ-Wpx.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1731348508165177344/pu/pl/1IbJGFWpkbk_JwL2.m3u8?tag=12&container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1731348508165177344/pu/vid/avc1/346x270/75CCYraQWZMv9F48.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1731348508165177344/pu/vid/avc1/926x720/PoPYbWl6P8xWzar7.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/itsPaulAi/status/1731348641720230385))
- Here’s the first prompt:
  “As a marketing consultant specializing in digital content analysis, scrutinize and evaluate the writing style, structure, and marketing techniques of the landing page at "YOUR LINK". Your assessment should include:
  1. A detailed breakdown of the text on the page, segment by segment.
  2. An analysis of each segment, focusing on its purpose and effectiveness in a marketing and copywriting context.
  Your evaluation should be presented in a structured format:
  - Begin by quoting or summarizing the text from a specific segment of the landing page.
  - Follow with a bullet point analysis of that segment, explaining how the writing style, structure, and marketing techniques are employed and their intended impact on the reader or potential customer.
  Ensure that your analysis is thorough and insightful, demonstrating your deep understanding of digital marketing strategies and copywriting principles. Maintain a professional and analytical tone throughout the report.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/itsPaulAi/status/1731348776743305301))
- All you have to do is write your new page based on this analysis.
  You can use this second prompt below to have GPT-4 do it for you. <video controls><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1731348823388090368/pu/vid/avc1/346x270/N4S9bk9VM1GBeMAv.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1731348823388090368/pu/vid/avc1/462x360/6bAlWBLp-0FNY2cf.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1731348823388090368/pu/pl/EZv2BHVFvwOvUDVz.m3u8?tag=12&container=fmp4" type="application/x-mpegURL"><source src="https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/1731348823388090368/pu/vid/avc1/926x720/v6VpBXrIRzB3V9xo.mp4?tag=12" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video> ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/itsPaulAi/status/1731348942212710759))
- Second prompt :
  “Create a compelling landing page for a [PRODUCT] titled "[TITLE]". Your page should reflect the effective structure and marketing techniques identified in the analysis of "YOUR LINK".
  The landing page should include all the elements present in the latter.” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/itsPaulAi/status/1731349025834647797))
- Starting from an existing structure that works is the best way to achieve effective copywriting!
