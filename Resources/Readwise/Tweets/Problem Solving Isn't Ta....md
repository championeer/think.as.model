## Highlights
- Problem solving isn't taught.
  But it's something we should learn. 
  Here are the top problem solving methods you can start using today: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/_alexbrogan/status/1578010986103160834))
- Find The Root Cause
  A proximate cause is the most immediately observable cause of a problem. 
  The symptom. 
  The root cause is the underlying reason. 
  The disease. 
  When problem solving, find the root cause to ensure it doesn't happen again.
  How? The 5 Whys Method

- The Minto Pyramid Principle
  A McKinsey developed framework for writing and presenting ideas.
  "A tool to help you find out what you think."
  Process:
  1. Start with the problem first
  2. Group and summarize your supporting arguments
  3. Logically order your supporting ideas

- Ishikawa Diagram
  A diagram indicating the possible root causes of a problem.
  Steps:
  1. Define the problem (Product failure)
  2. Identify contributing factors (Blue ovals)
  3. Find possible root causes related to each factor (Black text and arrows)
  4. Analyse the diagram

- Inversion
  When problem solving, consider the opposite of what you want—the worst-case scenario or solution. 
  Now ask, "How do I avoid this happening?"
  Inversion teaches you what to avoid on the path to success. 
  Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking excellence.

- Issue Trees 
  Issue trees are a visual diagram that help you break down a larger problem or question into several smaller, more solvable questions. 
  They allow you to identify the root causes of a problem as well as to identify its potential solutions.
