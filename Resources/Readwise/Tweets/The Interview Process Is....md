## Highlights
- The interview process is ultra-competitive.
  But with proper preparation, it is possible to stand out.
  THREAD: 20 common interview questions, what they really mean, and how to nail them: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971814443819009))
- “Why this company?”
  This is a standard test for for shotgun blast applicants.
  A generic answer can derail your process.
  Do your research. Write down 2-3 unique points about the company that appeal to you.
  You won’t get the job with your answer, but you can definitely lose it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971815328731140))
- “Tell me about yourself.”
  This isn’t an invitation to recite your resume.
  This is a test of whether you can provide a concise, thoughtful overview of your past, present, and future.
  Keep it short. Focus on key information, decisions, and insights that may not pop off the page. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971816201129984))
- “Why should we hire you?”
  Direct and intimidating, it serves as a test of the candidate’s selling skills and stress capacity.
  A golden opportunity to exhibit your preparation for the interview.
  A clear, concise review of your relevant skills, experience, and desire wins here. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971817023287309))
- “How did you hear about this role?”
  Seems like a filler question, but it’s a chance to stand out from the crowd.
  Hear about it through your network? Mention that!
  Learn about it from research on the industry? Tell them that!
  Find it on a job board? Say why it caught your eye! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971817946062850))
- “What are your strengths?”
  This is less about your ability to reel off strengths and more about how much you’ve researched the role and company.
  Provide 1-2 key strengths that make you well-suited for the job.
  Leverage storytelling - bring them to life with anecdotes! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971818998702081))
- “What are your weaknesses?”
  The majority of candidates try to pitch a weakness that is (not so) sneakily a strength.
  “I get TOO caught up in the details” (read: “I’m detail oriented!”).
  Don’t do this.
  Give a real weakness, but also how you are working to address it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971820039024640))
- "Tell me about a time you failed."
  This is an assessment of (1) whether you have faced failure, (2) your resilience, and (3) how you grew through the experience.
  You should have 1-2 specific stories to share.
  Be as clear as possible. Focus on the learnings from the failure. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971821012103172))
- “Why are you leaving your job?”
  This can be a test for negativity.
  Never say anything negative about your former employer (after all, this company may be your former employer someday!).
  Stay positive and highlight why the new company and role is a better fit for your goals. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971821939044354))
- “What would your prior boss say about you?”
  This may seem like a filler, but it’s a good opportunity to highlight a qualitative strength that you haven’t been able to talk about.
  Examples: Dependability, consistency, team-orientation.
  Be honest, but put one in the win column. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971822803070979))
- “Where do you see yourself in 10 years?”
  This is an assessment of (1) your ambition and (2) whether it aligns with your growth opportunity at the company.
  In answering, keep those two in mind.
  And it’s ok if you don’t have a perfect answer (I still don’t know mine!). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971823709007872))
- "How do you handle stress?"
  Stress is a reality - everyone gets stressed, and that's ok.
  Saying you never get stressed is not a viable path with this question.
  Talk about 1-2 specific tactics for stress management.
  Highlight a time when stress led you to rise to the occasion. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971824744996866))
- "Are you planning on having a family or children?"
  This is illegal in many countries, but sadly, it is still frequently asked (particularly to women).
  A simple reroute can work.
  Alternatively, it is perfectly ok to say that you are uncomfortable answering the question. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971825680330754))
- "What is your leadership style?"
  Leadership comes in all shapes and sizes. You don't need a fancy title to be a leader.
  Use storytelling. Be specific.
  Talk about a project where you led your team. How did you motivate them? What worked?
  Former athlete? Give a sports example! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971826577940484))
- "What are you motivated by?"
  Broad, sweeping questions like this one are designed to see how you think on your feet.
  "Money" is not a great answer (even if it's true!).
  Two options: Either (a) go broad ("taking care of my family") or (b) try to tailor the response to the role. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971827911626758))
- "What would you do in the first 100 days on the job?"
  This is a test of your preparation, research, initiative, and humility.
  Have a concrete plan for how you would approach your early days.
  Be sure fact-finding and learning is a key part of it (this is the humility aspect). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971828859645953))
- "How do you manage conflict at work?"
  This question is all about ownership and honesty.
  You should have 1-2 specific examples ready to go.
  What led to the conflict? How did you hash out the conflict? What was the result? What did you learn that you would do differently? ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971829786480647))
- "What other hobbies or interests do you have?"
  They want to know more about the you that exists outside of the workplace.
  Try to avoid being generic (seriously, does every single job applicant really like hiking that much?).
  You're unique. Let them know it! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971830713495552))
- "How many golf balls are used in the US every year?"
  This type of question tends to pop up in interviews for more technical roles.
  It's not about getting to the "right" answer.
  It's about showing a clear, straightforward process to get to an answer and then walking through it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971831669788675))
- "Is there anything else we should know about you?"
  This is a standard closing question.
  Resist the urge to say "Nope!" to end the interview.
  Give a (very quick) summary of your excitement for the opportunity at this specific company.
  It will leave a good final impression. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971832613457926))
- “What questions do you have for me?”
  This is a test of preparation and personality.
  Generic questions won’t kill you, but they won’t help either.
  Ask something unique and get them talking.
  I like: “What are you most excited about that you’re currently working on?” ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1423971833687257088))
- So those are 20 common interview questions, what they really mean, and how to nail them.
