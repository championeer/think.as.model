## Highlights
- 1/16 Documenting your TfT workflows
  One challenges I deal with is remembering how to use the TfT workflows I have created. 
  A workflow is a clearly defined goal and outcome, along with the steps required to obtain certain results.
  Documenting them is the key to success.

- 2/16 One example of a crucial workflow I use daily is designed for resurfacing information and also remembering important facts. 
  This workflow I use in @obsdmd with my notes. This workflow involves a number of steps, is ongoing with daily goals, along with goals for the future. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1480188855278047236))
- 3/16 The problem is I find it very easy to forget how to use this workflow and the net result over time I don’t get all the benefits of my Tool for Thought.
  The solution to overcoming this is a well documented workflow along with a periodic review of that workflow. https://t.co/0cJ38DR3HQ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1480188863209431048))
- 4/16 A well documented workflow includes these key elements:
  1. A witty name
  2. Clearly defined goals / outcomes
  3. Step-by-step actions that allow for being adapted
  A workflow is constantly improved, it is iterated to perfection. Yes, small changes accompanied by testing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1480188865868619781))
- 5/16 My example workflow for this thread is: Total Recall
  Goal: Remember important facts and intentionally resurface interesting notes using a Spaced Repetition algorithm
  Outcome: remembering facts that important to me, and resurfacing ideas I believe have value to future me. https://t.co/x91lxnsh03 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1480188874567598089))
- 6/16 Steps using while taking notes
  1. As I take notes, if an note has clear and relevant value for the future, tag it with #reviewFuture 
  2. Using the Obsidian Spaced Repetition plugin feature “Review”, once day use the “review” command to pull up a previous note. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1480188877302292480))
- 7/16 
  3. Grade if the note is still relevant so it will resurface later either sooner or a longer time from now.
  This process creates for an intentional review of an entire note, but spaced out based on my interest level.
  Goal is not memorization, rather serendipitous review.

- 8/16 However sometimes memorization is the goal, so…
  while taking notes, I might write certain thoughts that I want to embed into memory. That also has its own steps: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1480188886164856832))
- 9/16 
  1. Tag a paragraph with #flashcard and format it properly to be a flashcard for the Obsidian Spaced Repetition plugin
  2. Once a day go through my flashcards
  3. Grade each card, just as you do in standard SR review ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1480188887343546373))
- 10/16 Once a month I will review all new cards added in last 30 days just to reinforce that I have properly embedded the flashcard in my mind before allowing it to continue. 
  If I see I am having issues, I will reset the review value of the card to bring it back. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1480188888664748037))
- 11/16 Finally, as part of this workflow I have some things I want to memorize that are not in notes (like I am learning a second language, technical notes for work, certain life things). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1480188889851703299))
- 12/16 Using the Obsidian Templater plugin, I have created scripts that help me automate the process of quickly capturing these thoughts into the spaced repetition system I have in obsidian.

- 13/16 The goal is to use Obsidian for all spaced repetition needs, whether just reviewing notes, reviewing key thoughts from notes, or intentional memorization of other thoughts.
  This workflow I have been using now for 6 months, and have seen very positive effects. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1480188896659005442))
- 14/16 I now have a structured way to remember what is important, I am using a decent algorithm to space out the learning process & I really sense I am retaining this information better.
  This workflow went through a number of iterations to get it working smoothly and effectively. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1480188897812533255))
- 15/16 But having it written down helped me remember the workflow and made it easier to refine.
  I have other workflows for time management, turning fleeting notes into something useful, Project processes, goal build in and more. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1480188898961772546))
- 16/16 Key point of this thread: 
  DOCUMENT your workflows. 
  Name them, define the goal and outcomes, then step by step.
  Finally, constantly review them until they become automatic habits, and don’t be afraid to change them if they don’t work.
  Do you document your workflow? https://t.co/BpCzc0nUMC ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1480188907132268549))
