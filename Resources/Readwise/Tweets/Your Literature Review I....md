## Highlights
- Your literature review is not just a hunt for PDFs. 
  Become an expert by finding important SCHOLARS and JOURNALS. 
  Here is how to do this with @zotero, Google Scholar, @LitmapsApp.

- @zotero @LitmapsApp Science is made by people and published by people. 
  To really polish your understanding of the field, get to know these. 
  This tweet we discovered papers with @LitmapsApp (Step 3). 
  Let's start there and analyze their authors and journals!
  https://t.co/bF02tkFWzG ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Artifexx/status/1633045402915053568))
- @zotero @LitmapsApp @LitmapsApp is an app for discovery. 
  It will discover publications that you add to a growing colleciton. 
  When done, export this collection as CSV (will download a file).
  Open the CSV file with Excel. 
  Copy the DOI column (usually the first)...

- @zotero @LitmapsApp ...open Zotero and click the "Magic Wand" button. 
  Paste the DOI column from your CSV file. 
  This little trick will force Zotero to import ALL data for each paper. 
  (Litmaps doesn't have all the data we will need.)

- @zotero @LitmapsApp Let's identify frequent scholars. 
  Sort your collection by "Creator" (first author). 
  Papers by the same author are now next to one another. 
  In my case I notice that "Carnegie" contributed 3 papers to my collection. 
  (Find full name and other authors in the sidebar.) 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fqm-ITTXwAI79CV.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Artifexx/status/1633045411073064961))
- @zotero @LitmapsApp Google "<Author> Google Scholar Profile" to find their scholar page. 
  - Check for papers you missed. 
  - Bar graph shows you how long they have been active. 
  Try to answer:
  What this person is working on? 
  For how long?
  Did they pivot? Why?
  Get a "feel" for this author.

- @zotero @LitmapsApp Citations are not everything. 
  Sometimes 90% of citations come from a paper they published:
  - 20 years ago
  - or with 10 other people and are 8th author. 
  Look at citations by work - understand what they are VALUED for. 
  Co-authors may give you an even better feel for this.

- @zotero @LitmapsApp Take linked notes on authors, like you do on publications.
  They are potential
  âœ… Collaborators
  âœ… Mentors
  âœ… Thought leaders 
  Think of them as "your teachers", even if you will never meet. 
  (It's the same here on Twitter really. I follow people I respect and value.) 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fqm-IPzWYAA_abA.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Artifexx/status/1633045422741618690))
- @zotero @LitmapsApp Now let's look at journals. 
  In Zotero right click the title bar of the table. 
  Activate "Publication" and sort on it. 
  Do any journals pop out?
  I study "myrtle rust" an invasive fungus
  â†’ "Biological Invasions" seems very relevant. 2 papers are from that journal. 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fqm-ITkXsAIEgBr.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Artifexx/status/1633045424192778242))
- @zotero @LitmapsApp Find the journal's website online.
  Often there will be a search bar to search within this journal. 
  Here I search for "Myrtle Rust" and indeed find a paper I missed previously. 
  Add it to your collection in @LitmapsApp or @zotero. 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fqm-ISBWAAIX3BY.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Artifexx/status/1633045427363753985))
- @zotero @LitmapsApp I like to throw new articles into the "Seed Maps" function of @LitmapsApp . 
  This finds other related articles. 
  Interesting: I found a paper on tree extinction!
  It is more general than my topic: "myrtle rust". But myrtle rust is a fungus! 
  So this paper might be relevant. 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fqm-IS4X0AEr3fD.jpg) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Artifexx/status/1633045430845022208))
- @zotero @LitmapsApp Journals collect information on a topic. 
  If this topic is close to your lit review, read the journal.
  Your goal is not more PDFs, but to understand trends in the field. 
  Keep notes on these emerging concepts.
  Follow these rules to make it easier:
  https://t.co/dX8yJmVcNl ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Artifexx/status/1633045433822982152))
- @zotero @LitmapsApp Summary: 
  1. Export Litmaps â†’ Zotero (via CSV).
  2. Sort Zotero by Creator, find recurring authors.
  3. Study their profile. Are they collaborators? Mentors? 
  4. Sort by Publication to find relevant journals.
  5. Search your topic on journal web page & discover more literature.
