## Highlights
- PROMPT DUMP: CLOSE-UP PORTRAIT.
  Even though my posts don't get the interaction I was hoping for, I will keep on giving to the community that made this account grow.
  Here is the prompt. Modify, add/remove tokens and please do share your outputs:
  PROMPT: documentary, [SUBJECT], solarization effect, close-up intensity, associated press photo, exacting precision, dark romantic, captivating gaze, light-focus, award winning, HDR, raw texture, Hasselblad --ar 4:5 --s 250 --style raw
  You can also change [Hasselblad] with negative films. I encourage you to try Lomography Lady Grey, Lomography Color Negative and Agfa Vista.
  Cheers! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/the_aeye/status/1713628294149541999))
