## Highlights
- Many PMs struggle with creating the right success metrics for their products.
  As with most other things, they over complicate the process in their heads.
  I follow a simple 5 step process. 
  But the main message here is that metrics are always an answer to a question. So asking the right questions is the real winner in such cases.
  Let's see this with an example - IG Reels
  **Step 1:** Company Vision
  Without having a larger vision in mind, it is impossible to know if you're selecting the right metrics.
  IG Vision: "Give people the power to build community"
  **Step 2:** Metric buckets
  I like to think of success throughout the funnel. 
  In the case of IG reels, I would think of
  - Adoption
  - Engagement and retention
  - Quality
  - Guardrails
  **Step 3:** Think of the best questions
  - North star metric (NSM):
  - Are we headed in the right direction?
  - Are more users using it and are users using it more?
  **Adoption:**
  How many users are using it?
  What is the headroom
  **Engagement and Retention**
  Are users liking it?
  How many users like it?
  Are they liking it enough to keep coming back?
  **Quality:**
  Are users having a good quality experience?
  Is there enough high quality content available?
  **Guardrails:** 
  Will improving reels lead to negative impact on IG ecosystem (stories, feed, search, etc.)
  **Step 4:** think of answers
  **North Star**: 
  - Total Hours spent on IG Reels / week
  **Rationale:** The metric will increase if more users are using or users is spending more time.
  **Adoption:**
  - WAU
  - Reels WAU / IG WAU
  **R:** Gives a sense of how many are using, and how many should be using it (headroom)
  **Engagement and retention**
  - Median minutes spent per user per week
  - DAU/WAU (stickiness)
  **R:** measures how much they like it, and how many users like it enough to be sticky.
  **Quality**
  - Total new reels with > X views created per week
  - Same metric by category
  - Avg. skips per user per week (good quality)
  - Total no. of reports (bad quality)
  **R:** answers if there are enough high quality reels across different categories. Also measures if users are finding relevant reels
  **Guardrails**
  - Total minutes on IG per week
  - Total revenue from IG per week
  - ARPU from IG per week
  - Avg. no. of actions per user per week
  Guardrails help you monitor OVERALL impact to the product. In this case, improvement in reels should not lead to decrease in metrics for IG (stories, feed, etc.)
  **Step 5:** think of tradeoffs:
  - No creator side metrics
  - No revenue metrics
  **R:** Ok to make these tradeoffs, because: consumers spending more time on reels means they are engaging with creator's content and helping them get value. Also more time leads to more ad impressions and revenue.
