- 1📌 The DWMM Matrix
  Prioritize your to-dos with the "Do What Matters Most" Matrix.
  ♦️High Priority Low Stress: Do a lot of these.
  ♦️High Priority High Stress: Max 1 X day.
  ♦️Low Priority High Stress: Delegate or knock-off in bulk without fuss.
  ♦️Low Priority Low Stress: Delete.

- 2📌 The 2-Minute Rule
  ♦️Use the 2-minute rule to avoid cluttering your to-do list.
  ➜ The leaner your to-do list, the easier it is to get things done.
  ➜ Whenever a commitment pops to mind, if it takes less than two minutes, do it NOW!

- 3📌 The ABCDE Framework
  Use it to prioritize effectively.
  What would happen if you forgot to pick up your son at school?
  It would be a stressful situation.
  Therefore...
  ➜ "Pick up Derek" = [A] task.
  ♦️Never do a lower cat. task before completing a higher one.

- 4📌 The Keystone Habit
  ♦️If you don't get your Keystone habit done, everything falls apart.
  Instead of focusing on multiple things at the same time,
  pick a keystone habit and do your VERY BEST to get it done consistently. 
  ➜ The rest will take care of itself.

- 5📌 The Atomic Weekly Review
  ♦️Use this framework to review your past week, and plan for the next.
  Add some prompts to trigger self-reflection.
  Plan at least 1 important activity on each day of the following week.

- 6📌 The Landscape of Commitments
  ♦️ Having a lot of projects and to-do's can quickly make your life overwhelming.
  And sometimes it's not possible to cut down.
  ➜ In that case, group them ALL together on a big landscape of commitments.
  More clarity = Less stress.

- 7📌 Chunking
  Some individual tasks can be tedious.
  ♦️ But batch them together as in a routine and they will become more instinctive.
  Chunking can help you automate your processes.
  ➜ Group together activities you know you can tackle in sequence.

- 8📌 Buffer Time
  How many times your schedule overlaps?
  This is commonly due to poor planning.
  ♦️ But sometimes you just can't predict how your day will unfold.
  ➜ To make sure you're on top of things, add some buffer time in between your activities.

- 9📌 Theme Work
  Multitasking heavy lifts can result in serious inefficiency.
  ♦️ When handling big projects, make sure your utmost focus goes to 1 important category only on any given day.
  ➜ Theme your days to canalise your focus, and attack one important category per day only.

- 10📌 The Habit Threshold
  Habits are hard to develop.
  Studies show the average time needed to drill in a new habit is 20 days.
  ♦️ That is your Habit Threshold. 
  ➜ Whenever you implement a new habit, ALWAYS start with a 22 -23 day challenge, no less.
