- 1. Unconnected Notes
  I have close to 1000 notes.
  I might remember 50 of them by heart. 
  I can reach the remaining 950 ONLY IF my 50 notes link to them. 
  Link frequently!

- 2. Summarizing papers
  Think of a paper like a suitcase filled with information.
  It is not easy to access. Papers are meant to be brief and to TRANSMIT information.
  To optimize for understanding you need to UNPACK the knowledge, not compress it into an even smaller summary.

- 3. Not citing sources
  In academia you can't just make statements, you need to tell EXACTLY where this information comes from. 
  That is why with every piece of information you MUST provide a source (usually a paper). 
  Note how every paragraph has a paper attached to it:

- 4. Copy & pasting from others
  A year from now you won't remember which was copy & pasted and which were your own words. 
  A sure way to plagiarism. 
  Better: Never copy and paste. 
  Use this workflow if you need direct quotes from other's papers:

- 5. Not reviewing your notes
  Your notes are a garden. 
  Take a break and just READ what you wrote. 
  Even better: Write short outlines, to capture what you learn/think. 
  This creates links between concepts and papers! 
  Example:

- 6. Too long/short notes
  Rule of thumb: As short as possible, as long as necessary.
  If you re-read your notes frequently, you remember more. 
  Assist yourself here.
  Instead of "novels", write "news bulletins". Additionally link mentioned concepts to avoid repeating yourself. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Artifexx/status/1688077515049549824))
- 7. Not including key figures 
  A figure carries the information of multiple paragraphs. 
  Just screenshot them into your notes and you make them so much more readable. 
  Here is how:

- If you want to go a step further, make your own figures.
  Some papers especially in biology already have visual abstracts, but it is striking how rare this technique is in other domains.

- 8. Relying on memory
  Our memory is limited. This is why we have computers. 
  The key is to remember WHERE TO FIND things, not where they are. 
  I call these "Gateway Notes", their purpose is to link into a topic cluster.
  They are like a "librarian" that helps you find notes.

- 9. Not grouping topics
  Whenever you read something, tag it with its topic.
  It takes close to no time. 
  Here is how tags can help you be more creative:

- 10. Neglecting organizational notes
  Big organizations have multiple layers of management, small startups just a single founder. 
  Your notes are similar. 
  Once they grow, you need to add organizational notes, to use them efficiently.
