## Highlights
- The Option-Icon Pattern in Tana
  This is something I use quite a lot in Tanarian Brain and that I find super useful:
  Using emojis as status markers and still having descriptive names for the statuses as well.

- In the example above, the >Production Status field has a variety of options.
  A piece of content can be just an idea, I can be researching it, writing, filming, editing it, it can be ready to publish, scheduled, or published.
  Every status has an emoji for some visual distinction

- But I also want to pull an indicator of the item's status into its name, so that I can see how far along each piece is at a glance.
  With title expressions, that's trivial:
  ${name} | ${Production Status} turns into this:

- But I don't want to have the "name" of the status (like "Just an Idea") at the top level like this.
  So what do we do?
  Every status option gets a field "Icon" that has it's emoji as the value:

- And now I can pull _just the icon_ into the top level node with title expressions:
  ${name} | ${Production Status.Icon} gets me:

- This is a super neat pattern that makes title expressions in Tana very versatile.
  As I said, I use this quite a bit in my second brain template for Tana, Tanarian Brain: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1655573372040781829))
