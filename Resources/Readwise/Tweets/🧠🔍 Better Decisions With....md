- 🧠🔍 Better Decisions With AI 🧠🔍
  I've been using ChatGPT a to explore how AI assistants can help us make better decisions.
  Here's what I've learned so far: 🧵👇 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1636759341440303105))
- 📚🤖 ChatGPT knows MANY decision making frameworks
  And it can walk you through them step-by-step.
  It can ask follow-up questions, explain complex concepts, and make the decision making process much smoother too. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1636759344292433924))
- 🔑💡 One technique it has walked me through is the Key Assumptions Check (KAC):
  By asking targeted questions, this technique can help you scrutinize your assumptions and evaluate alternative scenarios.
  ChatGPT is perfect for this. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1636759347228454912))
- 🎯🤝 Another technique you can try is called "Analysis of Competing Hypotheses".
  The AI can help you generate alternative hypotheses, weigh evidence, and compare the likelihood of each one.
  It feels like brainstorming with a smart colleague! ⚖️💭 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1636759349896032259))
- 🎭🔍 I also LOVE doing "Red Team Analysis" with ChatGPT.
  It really helps to switch roles and analyze your own ideas from an adversary's perspective.
  This devil's advocate approach helps you spot weaknesses and identify counter-counteraguments! 💣🛡️ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1636759352798515201))
- 🔮💫 Right now I'm using it to experiment with "Scenario Planning".
  I use it to envision multiple future scenarios, evaluate their plausibility, and design strategies for each one.
  Again – it's like having a smart colleague to work the problem! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1636759355549941760))
- 🚀🌟 Using AI to apply analysis and decision making techniques can be super useful – whether you're a creator, entrepreneur, manager, or whatever else!
  With the power of AI, you can dive into structured analytical techniques like never before – it's a whole new world. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/cortexfutura/status/1636759358548889601))
