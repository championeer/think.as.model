## Highlights
- Many PMs struggle to explain the difference between Vision, Strategy, Objectives, and Roadmap. But those are extremely simple concepts.
  Let's tackle them one by one:
  1. Product Vision (Why)
  Product Vision is the long-term aspiration of your product. It motivates your team to wake up every morning and go to work.
  For example, ‚ÄúSend humans to the Moon‚Äù or ‚ÄúHelp tour operators focus on doing what they love.‚Äù
  An effective vision needs to be inspiring and emotional. It becomes much more memorable when it speaks to people's hearts.
  My favorite example is the JFK Moon speech.
  2. Product Strategy (Where & How)
  Strategy is not a plan, a goal, or a set of actions.
  It's a cohesive set of choices that you believe will allow you to win (achieve your Vision) at the playing field of your choice:
  - market and its constraints (e.g., geography)
  - value proposition
  - relative costs
  - tradeoffs
  - growth
  The strategy should pass the ‚Äúcan‚Äôt / won‚Äôt test‚Äù so that competitors can't copy it without sacrificing their existing businesses.
  3. Objectives (What)
  I love the OKR framework. It's a simple, incredibly effective approach for setting, monitoring, and achieving your goals.
  While following the SMART goals principle (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound), OKRs add an inspirational aspect to the Objective.
  4.¬†Product Roadmap (So What & When)
  Product Roadmap is a communication tool that allows you to align everyone in the organization. It creates focus on what‚Äôs important right now. It should also explain the reasoning behind it.
  In¬†3 Ways to Create 10X Better Product Roadmaps, I emphasized that it's essential to:
  - Focus on outcomes, not features
  - Do not commit too soon
  - Shorten the planning horizon
  My favorite format is the Now-Next-Later. 
  Hope that helps.
  What are your thoughts?
