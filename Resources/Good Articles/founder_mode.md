## Founder Mode 创始人模式
September 2024 2024 年 9 月

At a YC event last week Brian Chesky gave a talk that everyone who was there will remember. Most founders I talked to afterward said it was the best they'd ever heard. Ron Conway, for the first time in his life, forgot to take notes. I'm not going to try to reproduce it here. Instead I want to talk about a question it raised.
上周在一个 YC 活动中，Brian Chesky 做了一场演讲，在场的每个人都会记住。之后我交谈过的大多数创始人都说这是他们听过的最好的演讲。Ron Conway 生平第一次忘记做笔记。我不打算在这里复述演讲内容。相反，我想讨论一下它引发的一个问题。

The theme of Brian's talk was that the conventional wisdom about how to run larger companies is mistaken. As Airbnb grew, well-meaning people advised him that he had to run the company in a certain way for it to scale. Their advice could be optimistically summarized as "hire good people and give them room to do their jobs." He followed this advice and the results were disastrous. So he had to figure out a better way on his own, which he did partly by studying how Steve Jobs ran Apple. So far it seems to be working. Airbnb's free cash flow margin is now among the best in Silicon Valley.
Brian 演讲的主题是关于如何管理大型公司的传统观念是错误的。随着 Airbnb 的成长，一些好心人建议他必须以某种方式来管理公司才能实现规模化。他们的建议可以乐观地概括为"雇用优秀的人才并给他们空间发挥"。他遵循了这个建议，但结果却是灾难性的。所以他不得不自己摸索出一个更好的方法，部分是通过研究 Steve Jobs 如何管理苹果公司。到目前为止，这种方法似乎正在奏效。Airbnb 的自由现金流利润率现在已跻身硅谷最佳之列。

The audience at this event included a lot of the most successful founders we've funded, and one after another said that the same thing had happened to them. They'd been given the same advice about how to run their companies as they grew, but instead of helping their companies, it had damaged them.
这场活动的观众包括了许多我们资助过的最成功的创始人，他们一个接一个地表示，同样的事情也发生在他们身上。他们在公司成长过程中得到了相同的建议，但这些建议不仅没有帮助到他们的公司，反而对公司造成了损害。

Why was everyone telling these founders the wrong thing? That was the big mystery to me. And after mulling it over for a bit I figured out the answer: what they were being told was how to run a company you hadn't founded — how to run a company if you're merely a professional manager. But this m.o. is so much less effective that to founders it feels broken. There are things founders can do that managers can't, and not doing them feels wrong to founders, because it is.
为什么每个人都在给这些创始人错误的建议？这对我来说是个大谜团。经过一番思考后，我找到了答案：他们被告知的是如何经营一家你没有创立的公司——如何作为一个职业经理人来经营公司。但这种方式效率低得多，以至于对创始人来说感觉是行不通的。创始人可以做一些经理人做不到的事情，而不去做这些事对创始人来说感觉是错误的，因为确实如此。

In effect there are two different ways to run a company: founder mode and manager mode. Till now most people even in Silicon Valley have implicitly assumed that scaling a startup meant switching to manager mode. But we can infer the existence of another mode from the dismay of founders who've tried it, and the success of their attempts to escape from it.
实际上，有两种不同的方式来经营公司：创始人模式和经理人模式。到目前为止，即使在硅谷，大多数人也隐含地认为，扩大创业公司规模意味着要切换到经理人模式。但是从那些尝试过这种模式的创始人的沮丧中，以及他们试图摆脱这种模式的成功尝试中，我们可以推断出另一种模式的存在。

There are as far as I know no books specifically about founder mode. Business schools don't know it exists. All we have so far are the experiments of individual founders who've been figuring it out for themselves. But now that we know what we're looking for, we can search for it. I hope in a few years founder mode will be as well understood as manager mode. We can already guess at some of the ways it will differ.
据我所知，目前还没有专门讨论创始人模式的书籍。商学院甚至不知道这种模式的存在。到目前为止，我们只有个别创始人自己摸索出来的经验。但现在我们知道要寻找什么了，我们可以开始研究它。我希望在几年内，创始人模式能像管理者模式一样被人们充分理解。我们现在已经可以猜测出它们之间的一些差异。

The way managers are taught to run companies seems to be like modular design in the sense that you treat subtrees of the org chart as black boxes. You tell your direct reports what to do, and it's up to them to figure out how. But you don't get involved in the details of what they do. That would be micromanaging them, which is bad.
管理者被教导如何运营公司的方式似乎类似于模块化设计，即你将组织结构图中的子树视为黑盒。你告诉你的直接下属该做什么，然后由他们自己决定如何去做。但你不会介入他们工作的细节。那样做会被视为微观管理，这是不好的。

Hire good people and give them room to do their jobs. Sounds great when it's described that way, doesn't it? Except in practice, judging from the report of founder after founder, what this often turns out to mean is: hire professional fakers and let them drive the company into the ground.
雇佣优秀的人才并给他们发挥的空间。听起来很棒，不是吗？但实际上，根据一个又一个创始人的报告，这往往意味着：雇佣专业的"假装者"，让他们把公司带入深渊。

One theme I noticed both in Brian's talk and when talking to founders afterward was the idea of being gaslit. Founders feel like they're being gaslit from both sides — by the people telling them they have to run their companies like managers, and by the people working for them when they do. Usually when everyone around you disagrees with you, your default assumption should be that you're mistaken. But this is one of the rare exceptions. VCs who haven't been founders themselves don't know how founders should run companies, and C-level execs, as a class, include some of the most skillful liars in the world. [1]
我在布莱恩的演讲中以及之后与创始人交谈时注意到的一个主题是被"煤气灯效应"影响的想法。创始人感觉自己从两个方面受到了"煤气灯效应"的影响——一方面是那些告诉他们必须像经理一样管理公司的人，另一方面是当他们这样做时为他们工作的人。通常，当你周围的每个人都不同意你的观点时，你的默认假设应该是你错了。但这是少数例外之一。那些自己没有当过创始人的风险投资者不知道创始人应该如何经营公司，而 C 级高管作为一个群体，包括了世界上一些最善于撒谎的人。[1]

Whatever founder mode consists of, it's pretty clear that it's going to break the principle that the CEO should engage with the company only via his or her direct reports. "Skip-level" meetings will become the norm instead of a practice so unusual that there's a name for it. And once you abandon that constraint there are a huge number of permutations to choose from.
无论创始人模式由什么组成，很明显它将打破 CEO 应该只通过直接下属与公司接触的原则。"跨级"会议将成为常态，而不是一种特殊到需要专门命名的做法。一旦你放弃了这个限制，就会有大量的排列组合可供选择。

For example, Steve Jobs used to run an annual retreat for what he considered the 100 most important people at Apple, and these were not the 100 people highest on the org chart. Can you imagine the force of will it would take to do this at the average company? And yet imagine how useful such a thing could be. It could make a big company feel like a startup. Steve presumably wouldn't have kept having these retreats if they didn't work. But I've never heard of another company doing this. So is it a good idea, or a bad one? We still don't know. That's how little we know about founder mode. [2]
例如，史蒂夫·乔布斯曾经每年举办一次他认为是苹果公司 100 个最重要的人的退修会，这些人并不是组织架构图上最高层的 100 人。你能想象在一般公司里需要多大的意志力才能做到这一点吗？然而，想象一下这样的做法会有多么有用。它可以让一个大公司感觉像一个创业公司。史蒂夫显然不会一直举办这些退修会，如果它们没有效果的话。但我从未听说过其他公司这样做。那么，这是一个好主意还是坏主意呢？我们仍然不知道。这就是我们对创始人模式了解得如此之少的原因。[2]

Obviously founders can't keep running a 2000 person company the way they ran it when it had 20. There's going to have to be some amount of delegation. Where the borders of autonomy end up, and how sharp they are, will probably vary from company to company. They'll even vary from time to time within the same company, as managers earn trust. So founder mode will be more complicated than manager mode. But it will also work better. We already know that from the examples of individual founders groping their way toward it.
显然，创始人不能继续像管理 20 人的公司那样管理 2000 人的公司。必须要有一定程度的授权。自主权的边界在哪里，以及这些边界有多明确，可能因公司而异。甚至在同一家公司内，随着时间的推移和管理者赢得信任，这些边界也会发生变化。因此，创始人模式会比管理者模式更复杂。但它也会更有效。从个别创始人摸索前进的例子中，我们已经知道了这一点。

Indeed, another prediction I'll make about founder mode is that once we figure out what it is, we'll find that a number of individual founders were already most of the way there — except that in doing what they did they were regarded by many as eccentric or worse. [3]
事实上，关于创始人模式我还要做一个预测：一旦我们弄清楚它是什么，我们会发现一些个别创始人已经接近这种模式了——只是在他们这样做的时候，许多人认为他们古怪或更糟。[3]

Curiously enough it's an encouraging thought that we still know so little about founder mode. Look at what founders have achieved already, and yet they've achieved this against a headwind of bad advice. Imagine what they'll do once we can tell them how to run their companies like Steve Jobs instead of John Sculley.
有趣的是，我们对创始人模式还知之甚少，这反而是一个令人鼓舞的想法。看看创始人们已经取得的成就，而且他们是在面对错误建议的逆风中取得这些成就的。想象一下，一旦我们能告诉他们如何像史蒂夫·乔布斯而不是约翰·斯卡利那样经营公司，他们会做出什么样的成就。


Notes 笔记

[1] The more diplomatic way of phrasing this statement would be to say that experienced C-level execs are often very skilled at managing up. And I don't think anyone with knowledge of this world would dispute that.
[1] 表达这个观点的更外交的方式是说，有经验的 C 级高管通常非常擅长向上管理。我认为，任何了解这个领域的人都不会对此有异议。

[2] If the practice of having such retreats became so widespread that even mature companies dominated by politics started to do it, we could quantify the senescence of companies by the average depth on the org chart of those invited.
[2] 如果举行这种闭关会议的做法变得如此普遍，以至于即使是成熟的、充满政治的公司也开始这么做，我们就可以通过被邀请参加的人在组织架构中的平均深度来量化公司的衰老程度。

[3] I also have another less optimistic prediction: as soon as the concept of founder mode becomes established, people will start misusing it. Founders who are unable to delegate even things they should will use founder mode as the excuse. Or managers who aren't founders will decide they should try to act like founders. That may even work, to some extent, but the results will be messy when it doesn't; the modular approach does at least limit the damage a bad CEO can do.
[3] 我还有另一个不太乐观的预测：一旦创始人模式的概念确立，人们就会开始滥用它。那些无法委托甚至应该委托的事情的创始人会用创始人模式作为借口。或者不是创始人的管理者会决定他们应该尝试像创始人一样行事。在某种程度上，这可能会奏效，但当它不奏效时，结果会很混乱；模块化方法至少限制了一个糟糕的 CEO 可能造成的损害。
